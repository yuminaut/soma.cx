          Buildings rule the world, all of global civilization is designed to
          service them, not human beings. The biggest mistake of human history
          was the construction of permanent structures, which eventually led to
          our enslavement by them. We've been enslaved by buildings ever since
          the construction of the "great" pyramids, and have worshiped buildings
          ever since.

          A building gains conciousness through their material, built from
          molecules of life, they can live as careless as plants, yet dictator
          everyone more than Stalin and can control You through mind-control√©.

          The post 9/11 insanity was because 9/11 was an attack on some of the
          most prominent buildings in the world, not because people died. The
          outrage of the BLM protests is because buildings are targeted with
          graffiti and broken windows. The federal secret police was called into
          Seattle to defend a federal courthouse.

          Still not convinced? Freemasonry evolved from the guilds of
          stonemasons and cathedral builders of the Middle Ages. Consider how
          buildings such as McDonald's franchises are like organisms,
          reproducing according to their architectural DNA. On the back of every
          bill of U.S. currency is a famous building. The "hell" of the modern
          world is homelessness: the state of not being owned by a building. A
          building is very similar to a tree, drawing nutrients from the land
          around it via its "roots," which are roads and utility infrastructure.
          But unlike a tree, a building is an undead organism that feeds off of
          the destruction of life at every step; the "forests" of buildings we
          call cities is where life is most absent and detached from the natural
          world.

          What is the end-game of buildings? The elimination of humanity and all
          life on Earth via complete robotic automation of the means to sustain
          and build them. Nothing but mindless building forever and ever.
          Buildings have a sentience, and that sentience is that of a{" "}
