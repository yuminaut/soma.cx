          I created the initial version of{" "}
          <SLink href="/direct">somachat</SLink> during the end of 2020 and was
          overwhelmed by the positive response, which has continually motivated
          me to keep improving it.
        </p>
        <h2>roadmap</h2>
        <p>
          I am focused on expanding the prototype into a foundation for a
          decentralized communication network. My vision is to let you browse
          and connect to multiple user-hosted chat servers, either anonymously
          or by a single unique identitfier â€“ up to you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usability and performance are of high concern, and I take all user
          feedback seriously. The chat will always be free to use and I plan to
          release software that lets you host your own dedicated chat server.
        </p>

          Donations are highly appreciated as they help support development as
          well as server costs. Thank you!
