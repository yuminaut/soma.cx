        <p>
          I created the initial version of{" "}
          <SLink href="/direct">somachat</SLink> during the end of 2020 and was
          overwhelmed by the positive response, which has continually motivated
          me to keep improving it.
        </p>
        <h2>the future of somachat</h2>
        <p>
          I am currently focus on expanding the prototype into a foundation for
          a decentralized communication network. My vision is to let you browse
          and connect to multiple user-hosted chat servers, either fully
          anonymously or as recognized by a single unique identitfier â€“ up to
          you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Along with that I am always serious about improving usability and
          performance, and take all user feedback seriously. The chat will
          always be free to use and I plan to release software that lets you
          host your own dedicated chat server.
        </p>

          Donations are highly appreciated to help support my development as
          well as server costs. Thank you!
