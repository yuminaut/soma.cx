          You should be happy when you are sleeping in your bed at 5 AM. The
          world outside is more beautiful than ever, because it is empty. You
          are enriching existence with your absence, we all are.

          The death of the soul comes in the middle classes. Where dreams go to die. The middle class is a place of
          angst and lonlieness. It is a state of consumption with no time and no culture. The middle class is an
          abomination of modernity.

        <p>The middle class is the slave class.</p>

          Maslow's hierarchy is better conceived as an hourglass; once the
          pyramidion is reached, one can begin ascetic sacrifice... safety,
          food+shelter, prestige, intimacy; the shaman or the wild woodsman has
          none of these, and yet this is precisely the source of his
          self-actualisation...

          Much better to know your own body than to know 'the human body' as
          such. Every cell is engraved with the same personalities + memories
          contained in ur bloodâ€”every body has a specific language to
          communicate its needs. Ask ur parents the secrets they learned about
          their bodies...
