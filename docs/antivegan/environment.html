    <p>Many of the environmental arguments surrounding veganism rely on half-truths, statistical
        deception or outdated information from cherry-picked sources and environmental scientists
        who lack a fundamental understanding of agriculture. This becomes even more apparent when
        one realizes that the majority of environmental veganism is supported by vested interests,

    <h3 id="wiki_1._are_most_crops_grown_for_animals.3F">1. Are most crops grown for animals?</h3>
    <p>The core tenet of environmental veganism is the idea that that most of the world's crops are
        grown for animals, and that we could therefore reduce the amount of crops grown by eating
        more plants. This originates from a <a
            href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/8/3/034015/pdf"
            rel="nofollow">flawed paper</a> which was paid for by grain industries like General
        Mills and Kellogg. The formula they used determined the allocations of crops by weight and
        extrapolated that, since most of crop weight is used as animal feed, that most crops are
        separately grown as animal feed.</p>
    <p>The flaw in this formula is the fact that crops are never grown for a single purpose. This
        disregards that most parts of a plant are inedible to humans and that even the edible
        portions are often processed with milling or pressing and that produces additional
        byproducts. When we grow wheat for example, humans are only able to eat the smallest part of
        the plant, the fruit body. The rest of the plant (leaves, stems, husks, pods, etc.) are then
        fed to animals, some parts right away (the hay and leaves) and some parts later during the
        milling process (the husk and various forms of starches or sorghums, even gluten, which is
        hard for many humans to digest). In fact, 86% of animal feed worldwide is <a
            href="http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html"
            rel="nofollow">inedible by humans</a>. The overwhelming majority of it consists of
        forage, crop residues and by-products that have to be fed to animals because they would
        otherwise become environmental waste.</p>

    <p>As you can see, corn is by far the largest in gross sales for the USA, with more than three
        times larger the MT produced than the next largest, which is soy. Note that this data
        includes both animal and human food. Corn is a plant <a
            href="https://www.britannica.com/plant/corn-plant" rel="nofollow">native to the US</a>,

        in rotation with <a

    <p>Corn by weight sold is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corn_stover"
            rel="nofollow">half animal feed and half-human food. That is 50% of the harvest is
            inedible to humans. The animal feed portion is called corn stover.</a> </p>
    <p>As a result, out of total gross production of 256 million metric tons of corn in the US per
        year, half of that production is an inedible byproduct (corn stover and silage) or 126
        million metric tons. Even that figure alone is more than all of the meat, dairy, and poultry
        produced in the US combined (see above.) </p>
    <p>One can make lots of arguments as to why it should not be right that only a few companies
        produce massive amounts of GMO corn, however, this argument can be 100% independent of
        whether or not the inedible portions are used for animal feed.</p>
    <h4 id="wiki_1.3_soy">1.3 Soy</h4>
    <p>A common example vegans use is the <a

            rel="nofollow">USDA soybean factsheet</a> that states that 70% of the soybeans grown in
        the US are used for animal feed. However a few sentences later, it specifies that it does
        not refer to whole soybeans, but the parts of the crop.</p>
    <p>Quote:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>A distant third market for soybeans is biodiesel, using only about 5 percent of the U.S.
            soybean crop.</p>

            rel="nofollow">100% of soybean oil is for human use and is the main product of human
            consumption of the soy plant both in the United States and Globally.</a> This is where
        the demand lies. What animals eat is the meal that remains after the oil is pressed out. To
        be specific:</p>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soybean_meal" rel="nofollow">Soy meal</a> is the
        byproduct of soy oil extraction, where full-fat soybean meal (a complete soybean) is
        crushed, and approximately 19 percent is extracted into oil. </p>

    <p>So, once again, vegans have distorted data to present plant harvest and agriculture as
        completely different from how it is. In fact, food sustainability charities are already <a

    <h3 id="wiki_2._greenhouse_gas_emissions">2. Greenhouse gas emissions</h3>
    <p>The most frequently cited source on livestock greenhouse emissions is the 18% number from a
        <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a0701e/a0701e00.htm" rel="nofollow">2006 FAO report</a>.
        However, despite the fact that this number was retracted and lowered to 14.5% by its own
        authors in a <a href="http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3437e.pdf" rel="nofollow">2013 report</a>, it
        generally doesn't stop vegans from using it.</p>
    <p>Another claim that originated from this report is that the livestock sector has higher
        emissions than the transport sector. This comparison, too, <a
            href="https://news.trust.org/item/20180918083629-d2wf0/" rel="nofollow">was retracted by
            the authors</a> because it used a lifecycle approach that included every single factor
        in food production (e.g. processing, shipping), but didn't do the same for transportation.
    </p>
    <p>Of note is that none of these reports advocated for veganism, but for more intensive
        livestock farming.</p>
    <p>When greenhouse emissions are analyzed at a comparable metric, animal agriculture is a minor
        factor in the vast majority of developed countries - usually less than 5%:</p>

    <p>Most importantly, traditional livestock carbon footprint estimates <a

    <h3 id="wiki_3._water">3. Water</h3>
    <p>Water use is the the single most ridiculous example of how vegans deceive. For example, <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/suFOi35.png" rel="nofollow">this propaganda infographic</a>
        claims that cow milk needs twice as much water as almond milk, but <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/W72TvgG.png" rel="nofollow">a lifecycle analysis</a> by
        professionals shows that almond milk actually requires 17 times more water withdrawals.</p>
    <p>Vegans arrive at those inflated numbers because they present the total water footprint, which
        is divided into blue (sourced from surface or groundwater) or green (sourced from
        precipitation). Because 96% of beef's average water usage <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/3Ucaeps.png" rel="nofollow">is green</a>, <strong>they
            conveniently include the rainwater that fell on the pasture in their numbers.</strong>

    <p>When looking at <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature21403" rel="nofollow">the
            crops that lead to the most groundwater depletion</a>, it is evident that animal

    <p>When vegans misleadingly use the term "cropland" in the context of animal agriculture, what
        they actually refer to is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arable_land"
            rel="nofollow">arable land</a> that includes pastures. 60% of the world's arable land <a

            marginal</a> meaning it is too rocky, steep or arid to support crop production - yet it
        can be utilized for animal grazing. This also means that the land used for human food crops
        is typically in more productive conditions.</p>
    <p>What no eco-vegan ever talks about is how their approach is supposed to deal with the fact
        that <a href="http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2015/ph240/verso2/" rel="nofollow">we have
