                on a long-term perspective. These data should be collected and analyzed more

        <li><em>Any diet that does not lead to the intake of adequate levels of essential nutrients
                and energy is unfavourable. The DGE recommends a diet that includes all groups of
                foods in the nutrition circle - including animal products.</em></li>
        <li><em>Special care is needed for groups with special requirements for nutrient supply,
                e.g. pregnant women, lactating women, infants and toddlers.</em></li>
        <li><em>On a vegan diet, it is difficult or impossible to ensure adequate supply of some
                nutrients. The most critical nutrient is vitamin B12. Other potentially critical
                nutrients on a vegan diet include protein resp. indispensable amino acids and
                long-chain n-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA), other vitamins (riboflavin, vitamin D) and
                minerals (calcium, iron, iodine, zinc and selenium).</em></li>
        <li><em>With some nutrients, a vegan diet without fortified foods or dietary supplements
                leads to inadequate intake, which may have considerable unfavourable consequences
                for health.</em></li>
        <li><em>The risk of nutrient under-supply or a nutritional deficiency is greater in persons
                in sensitive phases of life, such as pregnancy, lactation and in infants, children

                thus of health disorders, a vegan diet is not recommended by the DGE during

        <li><em>The current craze for vegan diets has an effect on the pediatric population. This
                type of diet, which does not provide all the micronutrient requirements, exposes
                children to nutritional deficiencies. These can have serious consequences,
                especially when this diet is introduced at an early age, a period of significant
                growth and neurological development.</em></li>

        Blanket claims and conflicts of interest in vegan position papers</h4>
    <p>The false consensus on vegan diets being &#39;appropriate&#39; originates from the (most

            efforts</a> in order to convert people to the Biblical &quot;Garden of Eden diet&quot;
        (which is vegan). They have been writing these sorts of papers to advocate for vegetarian
        diets <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xbjCNcK.png" rel="nofollow">since 1988</a>, in the same
        year they finished the first Adventist Health Study, <em>citing themselves</em>. Despite the
        authors explicitly stating that there is no conflict of interest, all three of them have
        devoted their career to promoting veganism and <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tEwaqLU.png"
            rel="nofollow">are</a> citing <a href="https://i.imgur.com/SpKItps.png"

    <p>This position paper does a poor if not outright deceiving job of drawing conclusions from the
        data. For example, the &quot;vegans&quot; in the studies that they use to praise the health
        benefits <a href="https://i.imgur.com/x2sfW96.jpg" rel="nofollow">could eat animals
            products</a>. They are also not citing any studies that were done in the very long-term,
        on athletes or on infants that have been monitored from birth to childhood. The authors
        state that vegan and vegetarian children have no issue with visual or mental development,
        but their source for this claim are <a
            href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0952327809000866"

            rel="nofollow">studies</a> that do not even <em>mention</em> vegetarian or vegan
        children. Their conclusions do not come from real-world data, but from theoretical
        speculation on nutrients - and they don&#39;t even mention many nutrients that have been
        linked to deficiencies in the past like <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19748244/"

    <p>When looking at the other organizations that approve veganism, a common observation is that
        they:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Either have no sources at all or just use the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics as
            their source. Most of these websites are just similarly structured copy-pastes of the
            ADA paper.</li>
        <li>Are much more conservative in their statement wording and say that vegan diets <em>can

    </ul>
    <p>The reason vegans have to appeal to these opinion statements in the first place is
        <em>because</em> there is no evidence to support their diet being appropriate for all stages
        of life. Which is what <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/health#wiki_1.1._organizations_that_do_not_recommend_vegan_diets"

    <h3 id="wiki_2._bad_science_supporting_veganism">2. Bad science supporting veganism</h3>
    <p>As already stated in the 2018 Swiss Federal Commission for Nutrition report, there is a lack
        of data on veganism because there are only a handful of large studies - and none of them
        have monitored their very long-term impact on health. Nutrition science is a <a
            href="https://sandpit.bmj.com/site_images/2018/food_timeline_v13_web.png"
            rel="nofollow">very new field</a> in general and most studies on vegans rely on
        questionnaire-based food intake surveys. These are <a
            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4527547" rel="nofollow">fundamentally
            and fatally flawed</a> because they usually ask people to remember what they have eaten
        in the last year and then just assume their diet stays like this throughout the study. This
        is problematic because not only do people misremember their dietary intake, they also tend
        to lie about it. Veg*ans in particular <a
            href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/animals-and-us/201109/why-are-there-so-few-vegetarians"
            rel="nofollow">are known</a> to <a
            href="https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/millions-brits-lying-being-vegan-21554332"
            rel="nofollow">lie</a> about what they eat because they are surrounded by an ideology
        that demonizes the consumption of animal products.</p>
    <h4 id="wiki_2.1._adventist_health_studies">2.1. Adventist Health Studies</h4>
    <p>The AHS are the most commonly cited studies in support of veganism. This is because they are
        also the only cohort studies that show vegans to have lower all-cause mortality than the
        average obese american. The Swiss Federal Commission for Nutrition notes <a
            href="https://www.blv.admin.ch/dam/blv/en/dokumente/das-blv/organisation/kommissionen/eek/vor-und-nachteile-vegane-ernaehrung/vegan-report-final.pdf.download.pdf/vegan-report-final.pdf"
            rel="nofollow">in their report</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Separate analyses for breast cancer mortality exhibited a significant reduction in this
            risk for the SDA studies (-43%; 95% CI: 0.34 - 0.95), but in contrast, an almost
            significant increase of + 40% (95% CI: 0.98 - 2.01) for the non-SDA studies.</p>
        <p>The reduction in IHD and all-cause mortality with vegetarian diet stems mainly from the
            Adventist studies, and there is much less convincing evidence from studies conducted in
            other populations. Once the SDA studies have been excluded, the results are either less
            significant or with a lesser magnitude of benefit,</p>
        <p>For colon-rectum cancer conflicting results were observed between the Adventist Health
            Study 2 (- 14%; 95% CI: 0.59 - 1.24) and the Oxford Vegetarian Study &amp; EPIC-Oxford
            Cohort (+31%; 95% CI: 0.82 - 2.11).</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>The Adventist studies cannot be applied to the general population, and there are many reasons
        for this. For example, Adventists have a religious believe that <a
            href="https://m.egwwritings.org/en/book/705.19" rel="nofollow">meat will give them
            cancer</a> and could have underreported their actual consumption due to <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias" rel="nofollow">social
            desirability bias</a>. The authors <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/health#wiki_1.2._blanket_claims_and_conflicts_of_interest_in_vegan_position_papers"
            rel="nofollow">falsely categorized flexitarians</a> as &quot;vegans&quot; for marketing
        purposes because they couldn&#39;t even find enough pure vegans in their population.</p>
    <p>What&#39;s particularly noteworthy is that there is an undeclared <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/6s35X68.jpg" rel="nofollow">triple conflict of interest</a> in
        these studies with funding, scientists and study subjects all being driven by an ideological
        agenda that suggests that <a
            href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/secret-ingredient-kelloggs-corn-flakes-seventh-day-adventism-180964247/"
            rel="nofollow">meat causes masturbation</a>. Perhaps the observation that authors like
        <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Joan_Sabate" rel="nofollow">J. Sabate</a> and
        <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Winston_Craig" rel="nofollow">W. Craig</a>
        mostly seem to publish outcomes that favour veganism could be explained by the largest
        Seventh-Day Adventist church being located <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loma_Linda_University_Church" rel="nofollow">on the
            campus of Loma Linda University</a>, that Adventists own <a

            rel="nofollow">driven by SDA studies</a>.
    </p>
    <h4 id="wiki_2.2._ex-vegans">2.2. Ex-Vegans</h4>
    <p>Vegan diets have low adherence rates, meaning that most people stop being vegan sooner or
        later. It is therefore not surprising that former vegans massively outnumber current vegans,
        of which <a href="https://i.imgur.com/AQZQbIC.jpg" rel="nofollow">the majority</a> have only
        been vegan for a short time.</p>
    <p><a href="https://bit.ly/3cqvQzS" rel="nofollow">Common reasons</a> that these people quit
        are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Concerns about health (23%)</li>
        <li>Cravings (37%)</li>
        <li>Social problems (63%)</li>
        <li>Not seeing veganism as part of their identity (58%)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>29% had <a
            href="https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Faunalytics_Current-Former-Vegetarians_Full-Report.pdf#page=7"
            rel="nofollow">health problems</a> such as nutrient deficiencies, depression or thyroid
        issues. 82% of these problems improved after reintroducing meat.</p>
    <p>This means that there are likely more people that quit veganism with health problems than
        there are vegans.</p>
    <p>Cohort studies on vegans only consider the people who did not quit the diet. Due to this
        confounding factor (survivorship bias), they fail to expose negative health consequences as
        most reasonable people are going to quit the diet once they start getting ill.</p>
    <h4 id="wiki_2.3._reversal_of_heart_disease">2.3. Reversal of heart disease</h4>
    <p>Another common claim is that the vegan diet is &quot;clinically proven to reverse heart
        disease&quot;. The <a href="https://www.medpagetoday.com/blogs/skeptical-cardiologist/80783"
            rel="nofollow">basis for this</a> are two studies by Ornish and Esselstyn (two
        well-known vegan doctors), whose intervention diets ironically included dairy. Both of these
        had a low sample size (n=28 for Ornish, n=18 for Esselstyn), heavy confounding and terrible
        study design.</p>
    <p>For example, Ornish&#39;s intervention did not just include a plant-based diet, but also
        aerobic exercise, stress management, smoking cessation and group psychosocial support. Due
        to these confounding factors, the diet is a correlational factor so the study cannot be used
        to support the claim. As an extra fun fact: the intervention group had a mortality risk that
        was twice as high (2 vs 1).</p>
    <p>Esselstyn&#39;s study is often quoted because he claims to have achieved the reversal of
        heart disease with diet alone. Despite his study not even having a control group (meaning it
        was <em>not</em> a clinical trial), his intervention was confounded as well. In his own
        book, he writes:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Since the health benefits of relaxation and exercise are well documented, they were free,
            of course, to meditate if they chose to (none did) and I encouraged them to exercise
            (most chose walking—although there was an occasional jogger or swimmer).</p>
        <p>I asked them to keep daily food diaries listing everything they consumed, recommended
            that they take a daily multivitamin, and suggested that they moderate their consumption
            of alcohol and caffeine. And each participant received a prescription for a
            cholesterol-lowering drug. In the beginning, the drug was usually cholestyramine. In
            1987, when the first of the statins, lovastatin, became available, that became our drug
            of choice.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Also note that there was no dietary assessment, meaning that he had no data collected on
        total energy intake, macronutrient intake etc. Complete adherence to the diet regimen
        can&#39;t be verified. </p>
    <p>One thing that vegans seem to ignore about all of this is that one of the largest-ever
        clinical trials, the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16467234/"
            rel="nofollow">Women&#39;s Health Initiative</a>, saw no significant reduction in CVD or
        CHD when subjects were assigned to a dietary intervention that is low in fat and high in
        vegetables, fruits, and grains. This made Ornish <a
            href="https://www.edge.org/response-detail/25497" rel="nofollow">suggest</a> that we
        should discard the scientific method.</p>
    <p>Ornish&#39;s diet <a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=205916"
            rel="nofollow">has been compared</a> to the Atkins diet for change in weight and related
        risk factors. The Atkins group lost 10,4 lbs while the Ornish group lost only 5,6, Atkins
        led to better blood pressure, Atkins led to healthier HDL levels, Atkins led to twice as
        much improvement in triglyceride levels, and the Atkins diet was rated as easier to follow
        than was the Ornish diet.</p>
    <h4 id="wiki_2.4._blue_zones">2.4. Blue Zones</h4>
    <p>Blue Zones are another commonly used argument to support the vegan diet - even though none of
        them are even vegan. When investigated further, it becomes clear that the book was written
        to push a narrative, is incoherent with many observations and is misrepresentative of the
        actual diets these populations followed:</p>

        <p>The island of Sardinia not only has a large number of people who live to be more than
            100, but it is also one of the few places in the world were men live as long as women.
        </p>
        <p>Most regions of Sardinia are associated with incredibly good health, however, the region
            that has been highlighted as having a particularly long life is called Barbagia. </p>
        <p>I have had the privilege of visiting Sardinia, and several other places associated with
            longevity, during the filming of Statin Nation II. In Sardinia, I found the traditional
            diet to be in stark contrast to what Buettner describes. He states:</p>
        <p>&quot;It’s loaded with homegrown fruits and vegetables such as zucchini, eggplant,
            tomatoes, and fava beans that may reduce the risk of heart disease and colon cancer.
            Also on the table: dairy products such as milk from grass-fed sheep and pecorino cheese,
            which, like fish, contribute protein and omega-3 fatty acids. &quot;
            Unfortunately, this common myth about the traditional Sardinian diet has been copied by
            various websites and commentators. </p>
        <p>The cheese part is certainly correct. However, the Barbagia region is for the most part,
            up in the mountains, away from the coast, and traditionally the people who live there do
            not eat very much fish. Their diet manly consists of meat. Suckling pig being a
            particular favorite.</p>
        <p>In fact, in 2011, Sardinians called for formal recognition of their diet insisting that
            “the secret to a long life can be found in their traditional diet of lamb, roast piglet,
            milk and cheese”</p>

    <p>The China Study is perhaps the easiest vegan argument to debunk - because it has been

        <li>Claim 2: &quot;[Due to animal consumption raising cholesterol,] the findings from the

    <h3 id="wiki_3._bad_science_against_meat">3. Bad science against meat</h3>
    <p>Contrary to what some vegans might claim, the theory that red meat is bad for human health
        and causes obesity, diabetes, heart disease, cancer and even premature death is <a
            href="https://www.acpjournals.org/doi/10.7326/M19-1621" rel="nofollow">not substantiated
            by rigorous science</a>. The fact is, there is no evidence to back up these claims.
        Randomized controlled trials on humans, considered the gold standard of scientific research,
        <a href="https://pastebin.com/Y3q8R54C" rel="nofollow">do not support the idea</a> that red
        meat causes any kind of disease. Essentially all the evidence that vegans use against meat
        are poorly conducted survey studies that fail to replicate under experimental settings.
    </p>
    <p>The discussion should already be settled here, but since vegans are ideologues that will try
        everything they can to stop people from consuming animal products, they will usually resort
        to two kinds of arguments:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Pointing out how RTCs are hard to conduct in nutrition, and therefore suggesting that we
            should rely on non-replicable epidemiology instead</li>
        <li>Appealing to authority</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Both of these are terrible arguments.</p>
    <h4 id="wiki_3.1._epidemiology">3.1. Epidemiology</h4>
    <p>At best, epidemiological studies can show only association and <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_does_not_imply_causation"
            rel="nofollow">cannot establish causation</a>, which means that the data can be used to
        suggest hypotheses but not to prove them. Observational studies that link nutrition with
        disease generally find tiny differences in risk (relative risks of 1-2) which are not enough
        to generate confidence that an association is real. Relative risks below 2 are <a
            href="https://www.gwern.net/docs/statistics/causality/2004-shapiro.pdf"
            rel="nofollow">generally considered</a> in the field of epidemiology to be too small to
        establish a reliable correlation. Nutritional epidemiologists on the other hand, tend to
        overstate their findings to make news headlines and <a
            href="https://lesslikely.com/nutrition/nutritional-epidemiology/" rel="nofollow">will
            let almost anything pass as science</a>.</p>
    <p>Epidemiological studies rely on self-reported food surveys which can often be imprecise. <a
            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4527547/" rel="nofollow">Researchers
            from the Mayo Clinic</a> tested &quot;memory-based dietary assessment methods&quot; and
        found that the nutritional data collected was &quot;fundamentally and fatally flawed.”</p>
    <p>Only a small number of nutritional related epidemiological studies are ultimately confirmed
        by more rigorous scientific studies. In 2005, Stanford’s John Ioannidis <a
            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1182327/" rel="nofollow">analyzed
            several dozen highly cited studies</a> and concluded that subsequent clinical trials
        could only reproduce around 20% of observational findings. A 2011 paper published by
        Significance <a
            href="https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1740-9713.2011.00506.x"
            rel="nofollow">analyzed 52 claims</a> made in nutritional studies, and none—0%—withstood
        the scrutiny of subsequent clinical trials.</p>
    <p>Vegans love pointing the only exception of epidemiology that was made to determine smoking as
        a cause for cancer, but this analogy is irrational. In order to consider a causal
        relationship, an association has to fulfill all of the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradford_Hill_criteria" rel="nofollow">Bradford Hill
            criteria</a> which is clearly not the case for meat as the evidence fails even the first
        two criteria:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Strength: The relative risk of lung cancer was 9 to 25 times greater in smokers than for
            non-smokers. However, the WHO designation on meat and cancer relied on a risk factor of
            1.18.</li>
        <li>Consistency: Negative associations between meat and health are typically only found in
            Western cohorts, but in Asian populations it is <a
                href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3778858"
                rel="nofollow">associated with positive health</a>. Furthermore, the health of
            carnivorous populations such as the <a
                href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/22423982.2019.1638195"
                rel="nofollow">Sami</a> is comparable to the general population, while heart disease
            and diabetes problems in Inuit have only arisen <a

                abandoned their traditional diet</a>.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The reason medical professionals do not rely on this weak kind of evidence is because <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primum_non_nocere" rel="nofollow">it is
            malpractice</a> that could cause more harm than good. For example, the (observational)
        Nurses’ Health Study once showed that estrogen replacement therapy helped reduce heart
        disease in women. Later, a randomized controlled trial <a
            href="https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/33/3/464/716652" rel="nofollow">discovered
            that it actually increases the risk</a>. Another example are the USDA dietary
        guidelines, whose introduction <a href="https://i.imgur.com/9PESuNr.jpg"
            rel="nofollow">correlates with the obesity epidemic</a>. This could be a coincidence,
        but it is obvious that the guidelines were certainly not able to prevent it.</p>

    <h5 id="wiki_dietary_guidelines">Dietary Guidelines</h5>
    <p>One of their favourite appeals to authority is that, because so many guidelines recommend to

    <p>Sometimes, vegans will say that animal foods cause heart disease because they tend to

        supported by a statin trial paper like the <a

        is the single most researched topic in nutrition science.</p>

            rel="nofollow">strong link</a> between meat abstention and mental disorders, especially

            rel="nofollow">low in or devoid of</a> several important brain nutrients.</p>
    <p>An interesting observation is that a vegan diet itself qualifies as an eating disorder as it
        fulfills all the <a

            rel="nofollow">diagnostic criteria</a> of Avoid/restrictive food intake disorder. Given
        that veganism is an ideology that encourages the restriction of food under ethical pressure,
        it should be self-explanatory how it <a

    <h3 id="wiki_5._athletes">5. Athletes</h3>
    <p>First of all, it should be noted that there is actually no such thing as a &quot;vegan&quot;
        athlete. This is because athletes are required to consume more calories and therefore <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_2.1._animal_killing"
            rel="nofollow">kill more animals</a> for a profession which only serves entertainment
        purposes.</p>
    <p>Given that vegans are insanely underrepresented in elite-sports, they have to resort to
        highlighting individual, usually mediocre, athletes who tend to have only been vegan for a
        short period after a lifetime of meat eating. The irony is that, <a
            href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UKOY15ZEHjbl-j2JFkyDsx8JIsiiJLJUJmpEIXM-SxU/htmlview#"
            rel="nofollow">when you follow the progress</a> of their career, they almost always end
        up with injuries after about one year that they never recover from.</p>
    <p>For example, here are some of the athletes that were featured in the film Game Changers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Griff Whalen: went vegan 2014, out of the league 2016</li>
        <li>Bryant Jennings: went vegan end of 2013 (17-0 before vegan, 7-4 after vegan)</li>
        <li>Mischa Janiec: went vegan fall of 2015 - no wins 2 years after</li>
        <li>Kendrick Farris: lifts less as a vegan despite being in a heavier weight class</li>
        <li>Morgan Mitchell: slower than California high school girls. Her career was decimated
            after going vegan. She switched from the 400 m to 800 m because her time was so poor on
            the 400 m</li>
        <li>James Wilks: went vegan 2011, retired from MMA in 2012, won all of his matches as a
            meat-eater</li>
        <li>Derrick Morgan: went vegan beginning of 2017. Fewer sacks in 2017, bad year in 2018
            (huge reduction in sacks and tackles), retired in 2019</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Patrik Baboumian deserves a special highlight because he is probably the strongest vegan on
        the planet - so strong that he had to lie about holding a world record (for &quot;carrying
        the heaviest weight&quot;) which actually belonged to <a href="https://youtu.be/iJcvZIAsTfs"
            rel="nofollow">Brian Shaw</a>. The reason he holds a record at all is because it was
        made at an exhibition at a vegetarian food festival where he was the only competitor. He set
        up special rules for himself that would otherwise disqualify him from official strongman
        competitions, for example allowing himself to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZTaGZ6KLDwI?t=82"
            rel="nofollow">drop the weight</a> and then pick it up again.</p>
    <p>Patrik has never even been invited to World&#39;s Strongest Man and his strength does not
        come close to world-level athletes. For example, in 2012 <a
            href="https://www.greatveganathletes.com/patrik-baboumian-vegan-strongman"
            rel="nofollow">he deadlifted 330kg at a bodyweight of 127kg</a>, with his personal
        record being 360kg. But Ed Coan, who is roughly the same height, <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_Coan" rel="nofollow">deadlifted 409 kg in the
            100kg weight class</a>.</p>
    <p>Another thing to point out is that he literally <em>lives on supplements</em> because he <a
            href="https://youtu.be/aPJWOWePRGs?t=158" rel="nofollow">pops about 25 pills a day</a>
        to fix common vegan nutrient deficiencies (Iron, B12, Zinc) and gets over 60% of his protein

            rel="nofollow">drinking shakes</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="wiki_6._nutritional_deficiencies">6. Nutritional deficiencies</h3>
    <p>There is a widespread myth that vegan diets are adequate enough so that they only need to
        supplement B12, but the truth is that they are massively deficient in several other
        nutrients. Many of them can only be obtained because they are converted from other sources,
        which the majority of the population cannot do in adequate amounts. To name some examples:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The conversion rate of ALA (plant-sourced) to DHA is only 3.8% and further reduced by
            the intake of omega-6, which plant-sources of omega-3 tend to be high in. The synthesis
            of DHA in humans is <a href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/84/1/44/4633063"
                rel="nofollow">extremely limited</a>, hence adequate provision can only be achieved
            with direct intake. The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9637947"
                rel="nofollow">anti-inflammatory effect</a> of omega-3 does <a

                rel="nofollow">not seem to occur</a> when they come from ALA.</li>
        <li>Half of all UK women <a
                href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091118072051.htm"
                rel="nofollow">are unable</a> to adequately convert beta-carotene into Vitamin A due
            to a genetic variation that makes them poor converters.</li>

                rel="nofollow">plays a significant role</a> in overcoming insulin resistance for

                rel="nofollow">improves memory</a> only in people who don&#39;t eat meat, implying
            that humans can only synthesize enough to reach optimum levels.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>And this is just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
    <p>The vegan reply to this is that &quot;you can always just take a supplement&quot;, which is
        not only very disingenuous (deficiencies are often only detected when it&#39;s too late), it
        also ignores the possible adverse health effects of supplementation. Note that this exact
        argument is also used to defend vegan cats.</p>
    <p>The supplement industry in the US is <a
            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4330859" rel="nofollow">poorly
            regulated</a> and often sells products that are spiked with drugs. Vitamin B supplements

    <p>Here is a list of <em>currently</em> known nutrients that vegan diets are either completely
        devoid of or have a much harder time acquiring, especially concerning people with special
        needs or no nutritional knowledge. Vegans will always say that &quot;you can get X nutrient
        from Y obscure source that nobody even knows it exists&quot; - for example, they might claim
        that you can get Vitamin D from the sun, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that omnivores

    </h4>
    <p>There are two common myths that vegans use as a response to the fact that their diet is so
        poor that it requires supplementation for them to even survive.</p>
    <p>The first one is that 39% of the US population is deficient in B12 and should therefore use a
        supplement anyway. This number comes from <a
            href="https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/71/2/514/4729184" rel="nofollow">a single
            study</a> on people that all lived in the same city (Framingham), and only 9% actually
        had blood plasma concentrations that are typically diagnosed with deficiency (&lt;148
        pmol/L). This is a <em>very</em> clear case of cherry-picking. The <a
            href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2933506/"
            rel="nofollow">EPIC-Oxford</a> study for example found that 0% of omnivores, 7% of
        vegetarians and 52% of vegans were deficient in B12.</p>
    <p>The second myth is that livestock animals are supplemented with B12 and vegans are therefore
        just skipping the middleman (this is often supported by a <a
            href="https://www.vetnetsupplies.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/troy-b12-injection.jpg"
            rel="nofollow">picture of a supplement</a> that <em>explicitly states</em> that it is
        used to treat deficiency). There&#39;s also a blanket claim coming from <a

    <p>Vegans like to point to fibrous coprolites (or sometimes teeth) as evidence that prehistoric

    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Coprolites inherently represent a biased data set for interpreting human diet. Food items
            such as meat and vegetables will not leave any recognizable macroscopic traces in feces,
            while plant fiber, seeds, and bones often leave identifiable macrofossils</p>
        <p>Plant fiber is typically not affected by the human digestive system, so this will often
            disproportionally dominate the plant component of a coprolite</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Preserved feces are biased towards being fibrous (because non-fibrous feces are much smaller)
        and there are less than a handful of them in existence. The observation that vegans have to
        rely on this kind of questionable evidence should be a good hint how poor this argument
        actually is.</p>
    <p>Both teeth and feces are short-term snapshots of a diet and cannot inform about what someone
        ate over the long-term. It is plausible that this kind of evidence originates from starving
        individuals who tried to subsist on inedible plant-matter. In fact, the tooth sample <a

    <h5 id="wiki_isotopic_evidence">Isotopic evidence</h5>
    <p>Nitrogen isotopes indicate the trophic level position of organisms (reflective of the time
        the tissue samples were taken). There is a larger enrichment component with δ15N because its
        retention is higher than that of 14N. This can be seen by analyzing the waste of organisms.
        Cattle urine has shown that there is a depletion of 15N relative to the diet. As organisms
        eat each other, the 15N isotopes are transferred to the predators.</p>
    <p>Thus, organisms higher in the trophic pyramid have accumulated higher levels of 15N (and
        higher δ15N values) relative to their prey and others before them in the food web. Numerous
        studies on marine ecosystems have shown that on average there is a 3.2‰ enrichment of 15N
        vs. diet between different trophic level species in ecosystems. In the Baltic sea, Hansson
        et al. (1997) found that when analyzing a variety of creatures (such as particulate organic
        matter (phytoplankton), zooplankton, mysids, sprat, smelt and herring,) there was an
        apparent fractionation of 2.4‰ between consumers and their apparent prey.</p>
    <p>Every single isotope test that was ever done shows that pre-agricultural humans had higher
        15N values than other predators, meaning they also ate some predators in addition to
        herbivores. These tests show that the pre-agricultural human diet was around 95%
        animal-based.</p>

            proteins. Cave bears played the least important role, with a maximum contribution of
            around 5% of the total protein intake. These results are similar to those of

            show that Neanderthals had a similar diet through time (≈120,000 to ≈37,000 cal BP) and
            in different regions of Europe. The isotopic evidence indicates that in all cases
            Neanderthals were top-level carnivores and obtained all, or most, of their dietary
            protein from large herbivores. In contrast, early modern humans (≈40,000 to ≈27,000 cal
            BP) exhibited a wider range of isotopic values, and a number of individuals had evidence
            for the consumption of aquatic (marine and freshwater) resources. This pattern includes

        <p>Current consensus holds that the 3-million-year-old hominid Australopithecus africanus
            subsisted on fruits and leaves, much as the modern chimpanzee does. Stable carbon
            isotope analysis of A. africanus from Makapansgat Limeworks, South Africa, demonstrates
            that this early hominid ate not only fruits and leaves but also large quantities of
            carbon-13–enriched foods such as grasses and sedges or animals that ate these plants, or
            both. The results suggest that early hominids regularly exploited relatively open
            environments such as woodlands or grasslands for food. They may also suggest that

    <blockquote>
        <p>Gastric acidity is likely a key factor shaping the diversity and composition of microbial
            communities found in the vertebrate gut. The study conducted a systematic review to test
            the hypothesis that a key role of the vertebrate stomach is to maintain the gut
            microbial community by filtering out novel microbial taxa before they pass into the
            intestines. The study proposes that species feeding either on carrion or on organisms
            that are close phylogenetic relatives should require the most restrictive filter
            (measured as high stomach acidity) as protection from foreign microbes. Conversely,
            species feeding on a lower trophic level or on food that is distantly related to them
            (e.g. herbivores) should require the least restrictive filter, as the risk of pathogen
            exposure is lower. Comparisons of stomach acidity across trophic groups in mammal and
            bird taxa show that scavengers and carnivores have significantly higher stomach
            acidities compared to herbivores or carnivores feeding on phylogenetically distant prey
            such as insects or fish. In addition, the study found when stomach acidity varies within
            species either naturally (with age) or in treatments such as bariatric surgery, the
            effects on gut bacterial pathogens and communities are in line with our hypothesis that
            the stomach acts as an ecological filter. Together these results highlight the
            importance of including measurements of gastric pH when investigating gut microbial
            dynamics within and across species.</p>

    </p>
    <p>In humans compared to primates, the gut is reorganized. The size of the colon is much reduced
        and the size of the small intestine is increased. The human colon takes up 17-23% of the
        digestive tract. In chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas it occupies 52-54%. Instead of a
        large colon, humans have a small intestine that represents 56-67% of the gut (Milton, 1989).

    <p>These are important to note because of their role in digesting food. The small intestine is
        where primate enzymes digest and absorb nutrients immediately available in food. In
        contrast, the colon can be thought of as a bioreactor, where bacteria digest otherwise
        useless dietary constituents into important nutrients and other chemical byproducts. These
        include short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), organic fatty acids with 1-6 carbon atoms created by
        the fermentation of polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, protein, peptides, and glycoprotein
        precursors in the colon. The major source of these in primates is through the fermentation
        of fiber and some types of starch. The major difference in this matter between humans and
        the other great apes is that apes such as the gorilla are able to use their larger colons to
        obtain as much as 60% of their caloric intake from SCFA alone (Popovich et al., 1997). Upper
        estimates for human caloric use of SCFA range from seven to nine percent (2-9%). (McNeil,
        1984).</p>

            of High-Speed Throwing</a></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Humans are the only species that can throw objects both incredibly fast and with great
            accuracy. This unique throwing ability may have been critical to the survival and
            success of our hominin ancestors, helping them to hunt and protect themselves. Our
            research asks: How are humans able to throw so well? When did this behavior evolve? Was
            throwing important in our evolutionary past?</p>
        <p>We found that humans are able to throw projectiles at incredible speeds by storing and
            releasing energy in the tendons and ligaments crossing the shoulder. This energy is used
            to catapult the arm forward, creating the fastest motion the human body can produce, and
            resulting in very rapid throws. We show that this ability to store energy in the
            shoulder is made possible by three critical changes in our upper bodies that occurred
            during human evolution: 1. the expansion of the waist, 2. a lower positioning of the
            shoulders on the torso, and 3. the twisting of the humerus (bone in the upper arm). All
            of these key evolutionary changes first appear together nearly 2 million years ago in
            the species Homo erectus.</p>
        <p>We propose that this ability to produce powerful throws was crucial to the
            intensification of hunting that we see in the archaeological record at this time.
            Success at hunting allowed our ancestors to become part-time carnivores, eating more
            calorie-rich meat and fat and dramatically improving the quality of their diet. This
            dietary change led to seismic shifts in our ancestors’ biology, allowing them to grow
            larger bodies, larger brains, and to have more children.</p>
        <p>Armed with nothing but sharpened wooden spears, the ability to throw fast and accurately
            would have made our ancestors formidable hunters and provided critical distance between
            themselves and dangerous prey.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Although humans are relatively slow runners, compared to other mammals we are
            exceptionally good at running long distances. The evolutionary significance of this
            ability becomes apparent when it is remembered that our closest living relatives, the
            great apes, exhibit relatively poor running performance; being specialized for climbing.
            We have suggested that our bipedal hominin ancestors evolved to be exceptional distance
            runners as a result of selection to run prey animals to exhaustion in the heat of the
            day (Carrier, 1984), commonly known as persistence hunting.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Endurance running may be a derived capability of the genus Homo and may have been
            instrumental in the evolution of the human body form. Two hypotheses have been presented
            to explain why early Homo would have needed to run long distances: scavenging and
            persistence hunting. Persistence hunting takes place during the hottest time of the day
            and involves chasing an animal until it is run to exhaustion. A critical factor is the
            fact that humans can keep their bodies cool by sweating while running. Another critical
            factor is the ability to track down an animal. Endurance running may have had adaptive
            value not only in scavenging but also in persistence hunting. Before the domestication
            of dogs, persistence hunting may have been one of the most efficient forms of hunting
            and may therefore have been crucial in the evolution of humans. Xo and Gwi hunters at
            Lone Tree maintain that they concentrate on different species at different times of the
            year. They say that steenbok, duiker, and gemsbok can be run down in the rainy season
            because the wet sand forces open their hoofs and stiffens the joints. This is consistent
            with what Schapera (1930) reported. Kudu, eland, and red hartebeest can be run down in
            the dry season because they tire more easily in loose sand. Kudu bulls tire faster than
            cows because of their heavy horns. Kudu cows are run down only if they are pregnant or
            wounded. Animals weakened by injury, illness, or hunger and thirst are also run down.
            When there is a full moon, animals are active all night, and by daybreak they are tired
            and easier to run to exhaustion. The best time for the persistence hunt is at the end of
            the dry season (October/November), when animals are poorly nourished. When running down
            a herd of kudu, trackers say that they look to either side of the trail to see if one of
            the animals has broken away from the rest of the herd and then follow that animal. The
            weakest animal usually breaks away from the herd to hide in the bush when it starts to
            tire, while the others continue to flee. Since a predator will probably follow the scent
            of the herd, the stronger animals have a better chance of outrunning it, while the
            weaker animal has a chance to escape unnoticed (for more information, see appendix C).
