    <h2 id="wiki_ethics">Ethics</h2>
    <h3 id="wiki_1._definition_of_veganism">1. Definition of veganism</h3>
    <p>While <a href="https://www.lexico.com/definition/vegan" rel="nofollow">Oxford</a>, <a
            href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vegan" rel="nofollow">Merriam
            Webster</a>, <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/de/worterbuch/englisch/vegan"
            rel="nofollow">Cambridge</a> and the rest of the human population define vegans as
        "people who don't eat or use animal products", they themselves have come up with an <a
            href="https://www.vegansociety.com/go-vegan/definition-veganism" rel="nofollow">their
            own definition</a>:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>Veganism is a way of living which seeks to exclude, as far as is possible and
            practicable, all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or
            any other purpose.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This definition is quite laughable because it is completely vague und unstated, and so vegans
        can change their ethics on the fly to whatever seems convenient without a framework to judge
        it. They are therefore able to arbitrarily re-write their ethical stance in order to defend
        hypocrisy. For example, when they are confronted about the <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_2.2._animal_exploitation"
            rel="nofollow">massive exploitation of bees</a> caused by forced pollination,
        particularly in products like almonds, they will just <a
            href="https://www.veganlifemag.com/vegan-myths-avocados-arent-vegan/"
            rel="nofollow">refer back to this definition</a> and call it a day even though almonds
        are a completely unnecessary and avoidable food item.</p>
    <p>But when it comes to the consumption of animal products, they <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_2._vegan_hypocrisy"
            rel="nofollow">do not</a> apply the same logic. For example, one could call <a
            href="https://pastebin.com/s7z7H0CE" rel="nofollow">the Inuit</a>, a carnivorous tribe,
        vegan because they live in arctic environments where it's not possible to live off of plants
        - so they would not be able to kill less animals than they already do. Likewise, there's
        nothing that would inherently stop people from calling themselves vegan because they don't
        find it "practicable" to give up the taste of bacon.</p>
    <p>Jon Venus started to reintroduce eggs after the vegan diet did not work for him, but what he
        ate remained plant-based. Instead of staying consistent with their own definition, the vegan
        community decided to <a href="https://youtu.be/jMjf4-jc4Ew" rel="nofollow">attack him</a>.
        This pattern can be observed in <a
            href="https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/j5ymak/rawvana-vegan-youtube-influencers-quit-veganism"
            rel="nofollow">nearly every influencer</a> that quits veganism. The overwhelming
        majority of them <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/health#wiki_2.2._ex-vegans"
            rel="nofollow">revert to omnivorismn</a> sooner or later, so how could one even call the
        promotion of such a diet consistent with the philosophy when it doesn't cut the criterion of
        practicability?</p>
    <p>There are already many ethical belief systems around the avoidance of animal suffering that
        are thousands of years old, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jain_vegetarianism"
            rel="nofollow">Jain vegetarianism</a>. Many religions have pursued a vegan diet in the
        past - and all of them failed. Gandhi, for example, <a
            href="http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00litlinks/gandhi/part4/408chapter.html"
            rel="nofollow">was an ex-vegan</a> that nearly starved himself to death. As a result, he
        warned his followers to not make the same mistakes he did and allowed them to drink milk.
        The same is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhist_vegetarianism"
            rel="nofollow">true for Buddhism</a>. One could speculate that the current situation is
        an example of history repeating itself.</p>
    <p>But even though these religions are consistent with the vegan definition, they would never be
        accepted as <em>vegan</em> because they still promote the consumption of animal products. It
        is immensely arrogant to believe that nobody was able to care about animals before the
        invention of veganism by Donald Watson in 1944. In the end, veganism is really just the
        promotion of a 100% plant-based diet under an ethical premise, just how it was <a
            href="https://issuu.com/vegan_society/docs/the_vegan_news_1944"
            rel="nofollow">originally defined</a>.</p>
    <h3 id="wiki_2._vegan_hypocrisy">2. Vegan hypocrisy</h3>
    <p>Many vegans <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZLK3mfe.png" rel="nofollow">believe that they are
            logically consistent</a> because they don't kill or exploit any animals. They argue in
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_6._name_the_trait"
            rel="nofollow">black-and-white logic</a> that forbids any animal exploitation. They
        claim that <a href="https://www.milliondollarvegan.com/humane-slaughter-factory-farming/"
            rel="nofollow">there is no such thing as humane slaughter</a>. They will say that people
        who eat meat are <a href="https://i.imgur.com/GzEM1cP.jpg" rel="nofollow">murderers</a> and
        <a href="https://www.peta.org/features/rape-milk-pork-turkey/" rel="nofollow">rapists</a>.
        They think that <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_5.1_speciecism"
            rel="nofollow">all animals should be respected equally</a>.</p>
    <p>Often, vegans will <a href="https://i.imgur.com/ZD3K01I.jpg" rel="nofollow">claim that they
            don't exploit any animals</a> just because they aren't eating them. This idea is
        promoted by every one of their leaders, like <a href="https://youtu.be/TX8wKJw0ap4"
            rel="nofollow">Joey Carbstrong</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/3a67I08bl_U"
            rel="nofollow">Freelee</a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/_wSabaKvAuU" rel="nofollow">Vegan
            Gains</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/6xIWWtMLLQQ" rel="nofollow">Earthling Ed</a>.
    </p>
    <p>The truth is, they have no problem with <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_2.1._animal_killing"
            rel="nofollow">killing</a> and <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_2.2._animal_exploitation"
            rel="nofollow">exploiting</a> massive amounts of animals for themselves, while somehow
        arguing it is not morally justifiable to do so. More ironically, every single one of them
        relies on products that were made <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/environment#wiki_5.2._ignoring_animal_by-products"
            rel="nofollow">from animal corpses</a>. According to their own logic, vegans are
        murdering, raping animal abusers that engage in the same immoralities that they accuse
        others of. In short, they are hypocrites.</p>
    <p>Only after this is pointed out, vegans are now obligated to point back to their <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_1._definition_of_veganism"
            rel="nofollow">loose definition</a>, drop all the claims they've been making and
        completely change their moral framework by <a href="https://youtu.be/McW1fJHY0-Y?t=184"
            rel="nofollow">moving the goalposts</a> from "never murdering anything" to "causing less
        harm". Now, even if vegans did cause less harm (<a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_blaming_animals_for_crop_deaths"
            rel="nofollow">they don't</a>) and it was immoral to kill animals for food, then this
        still doesn't make them moral just because they kill <em>less</em>. According to this
        reasoning, Stalin was a good person because <a href="https://i.imgur.com/tevnNXF.jpg"
            rel="nofollow">he killed less people than Mao</a>. Besides, vegans already <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/PJzYs07.png" rel="nofollow">use the same logic</a> to support
        their black-and-white narrative on diet. </p>
    <p>Another thing that they love to do is justify their behaviour by making up reasons why <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_vegan_excuses_to_justify_animal_cruelty"
            rel="nofollow">their deaths don't "count"</a>. This is a great example of <a
            href="https://pastebin.com/67bi8n8w" rel="nofollow">cognitive dissonance</a>, something
        they often accuse meat-eaters of.</p>

    <p>In response to all the death and suffering they are causing, most vegans will now copy-paste
        a talking point from one of their <a href="https://veganspeak.org/vegan-arguments/#e38"
            rel="nofollow">argument guides</a> and try to blame animal agriculture for it by
        claiming that more crops have to be grown to feed animals. Typically this is supported by a
        link to <a href="https://www.animalvisuals.org/projects/data/1mc" rel="nofollow">a study</a>
        made by Mark Middleton, an ethically challenged animal rights activist who went to certain
        lengths to misrepresent this paper as actual scientific research. Note that this "study" was
        only published on his personal website, and not in a peer-reviewed journal like <a
            href="https://fewd.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/inst_ethik_wiss_dialog/Davis__S._2003_The_least_Harm_-_Anti_Veg_in_J._Agric._Ethics.pdf"
            rel="nofollow">the study he wants to debunk</a>.</p>
    <p>Despite claiming to record the "total animal deaths" in agriculture, this propaganda paper
        does not account for the deaths and suffering caused by the crop protection industry <em>at
            all</em>. It simply ignores the overwhelming majority of deaths which happen in plant
        agriculture, like <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_vegan_excuses_to_justify_animal_cruelty"
            rel="nofollow">vegans do so often</a>.</p>
    <p>Because Middleton only includes the deaths of livestock animals and mice that were crushed in
        grain harvest, even his own data <em><a href="https://i.imgur.com/t2xvHYM.png"
                rel="nofollow">literally shows</a></em> that meat and milk from grass-fed cattle
        kill fewer animals than a vegan diet. That is without including any other deaths, such as
        the 50 billion bees that are <a href="https://i.imgur.com/hESDk90.jpg" rel="nofollow">killed
            every year</a>. This is where vegans will now surrender and <a
            href="https://www.carnivoreisvegan.com/vegans-always-move-the-goalposts/"
            rel="nofollow">move the goalposts</a> to environmentalism and create a false dichotomy
        by implying everyone can only either be vegan or grass-fed carnivore. (Even accepting the
        fallacious premise of that argument, most cattle around the world <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cattle_feeding" rel="nofollow">are already
            grass-fed</a> with the US and Canada being exceptions to the rule. A vegan diet is also
        <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/114/48/E10301" rel="nofollow">not sustainable</a> for
        the entire planet anyway and there is enough land <a

            rel="nofollow">which can only be utilized by grazing ruminants</a>)</p>
    <p>Even for animal which are fed "crops", he tries to make innocent cows responsible for the
        deaths of billions of animals when a <a
            href="http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html"
            rel="nofollow">global FAO study</a> has clearly shown that their their feed consists of
        grass and <em>by-products</em> of the harvest that is driven by human demand. The edible
        grain that is fed to them is <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/environment#wiki_1.4_starches.2C_hay_and_grains"
            rel="nofollow">gluten</a>, which gets separated at the mill because humans do not digest
        it well. What this means is that all these deaths would continue to occur even if every farm
        animal magically disappeared. (see also: <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/environment#wiki_1._are_most_crops_grown_for_animals.3F"

    <p>Going forward, Middleton has done a great job at distorting the data and was likely even
        aware of it. For instance, the feed conversion ratios he ended up with were around 20:1,
        which he fabricated by using land usage as a metric (note that he never mentions how he
        calculated this number). But from the <a
            href="http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/home/en/news_archive/2017_More_Fuel_for_the_Food_Feed.html"
            rel="nofollow">FAO study</a>, we know that this number is actually only 3:1, making milk
        the best food choice in his chart. He also conveniently used a caloric metric, which was <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/environment#wiki_5.1_favourable_metrics"
            rel="nofollow">the most favourable for him</a>. Had he chosen one that is based on
        actual human nutritional requirements (say, protein), then his table would have favoured
        grain-fed beef <em>with crops deaths included</em> because <a

    <p>No matter how many deaths vegans make themselves accountable for, they will simply claim that
        more crops are grown for animals without ever proving it. <a

    <h5 id="wiki_vegan_excuses_to_justify_animal_cruelty">Vegan excuses to justify animal cruelty
    </h5>
    <p>In this episode of Poor Vegan Logic we’ll explore the silly vegan idea that veganism
        supposedly only kills animals accidentally, and that being indirectly responsible for animal
        deaths excuses them from doing actions that they themselves consider immoral.</p>
    <p>The comment <a href="https://i.imgur.com/eGOpsuW.png" rel="nofollow">here</a> is a hilarious
        example of poor vegan logic that it’s adherents obviously have not thought about too much -
        since it’s so obviously and provably wrong. This is an example of vegans reacting to someone
        showing them how much death they are really contributing to. Let's go over the most common
        talking points.</p>
    <p><strong>Direct vs Indirect Killing</strong></p>
    <p>Many vegans seem to claim that <em>direct</em> killing is less ethical than <em>indirect</em>
        killing. This is obviously false, and is even encoded in the human legal system whereby
        someone who contracts for a murder is still responsible for that murder just as if they were
        to have done it themselves.</p>
    <p>If indirect killing was more ethical, regardless of the knowledge one has that it’s your
        consumption that is having the animal killed or how many are killed, then we could all just
        let the abattoir kill our meat, buy it in a grocery store, and vegans would be satisfied
        with this.</p>
    <p>Obviously vegans do not believe that meat eaters are absolved of responsibility simply
        because they didn’t do the killing themselves, so why do they not hold themselves to the
        same standard? Because someone else applied the pesticides they are absolved of their
        responsibility for their food choices? This is a typical example of a double standard using
        bad vegan logic.</p>
    <p><strong>Accidental vs Intentional Killing</strong></p>
    <p>The other argument made is the accidental vs intentional deaths. This argument is even more
        ridiculous since one can hardly call the mass killing of insects by intentionally spraying
        pesticides, the poisoning of mice and rats in fields, the destruction of the homes of
        spiders and birds during the harvest, and many other animal deaths that occur to bring
        plants to a vegan’s plate "<a href="https://i.imgur.com/EfDJPrp.jpg"
            rel="nofollow">accidental</a>". Take a moment and realize that there is a <a
            href="https://www.boell.de/sites/default/files/2020-05/insectatlas2020_web_200525.pdf#page=20"
            rel="nofollow">56.5 billion dollar industry</a> dedicated solely to kill animals for the
        crops they so deeply desire.</p>
    <p>Perhaps they mean the deaths that accrue when:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Birds that eat the poisoned insects are killed</li>
        <li>Frogs get eaten at a 25 times higher rate because of the neurotoxins that slow their
            responses</li>
        <li>Rodents are run over by harvesting equipment</li>
        <li>Spiders are chewed up by threshers</li>
        <li>Huge ocean dead zones of marine are killed from pesticide runoff</li>
        <li>Mass bee deaths occur from pesticides and working them to death</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But can those really be called "accidental" when the effects have been studied and are <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/qCx39il.jpg" rel="nofollow">well-known, predictable, and occur
            year after year after year</a>?</p>
    <p><strong>Other people also eat plants</strong></p>
    <p>Another obfuscation tactic is for them to say that "everyone else" eats plants too, and
        therefore the animal deaths have nothing to do with veganism, even though it’s directly
        related to eating plants vs animals. And they will continue on in their ignorance of the
        death, or environmental destruction, or the poor health of their fellow humans they are
        advocating for.</p>
    <p>Remember, vegans only make up about 0.5% of the population, so it’s easy for them to disclaim
        that vegans have any responsibility for anything.</p>
    <p><strong>Sentience</strong></p>
    <p>In order to dismiss the majority of death and suffering caused by plant-based diets, many
        vegans will simply state that the animals are not (or less) "sentient" and can be ignored.
        Yet, their <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_1._definition_of_veganism"
            rel="nofollow">own definition</a> states that it is about the reduction of
        <em>cruelty</em> to animals and they are even forced to <a
            href="https://yourveganfallacyis.com/en/animals-are-not-intelligent-enough-to-matter"
            rel="nofollow">state themselves</a> that intelligence is not a factor to determine
        suffering so that they have an argument for pigs and cows. Once again, this is a case of
        vegans being inconsistent with their own philosophy.</p>
    <p>Note that further, sentience as a concept is impossible to quantify or even define. Which is
        why the government of New Zealand has <a
            href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/australasia/animals-are-now-legally-recognised-as-sentient-beings-in-new-zealand-10256006.html"
            rel="nofollow">legally declared</a> that <em>all</em> animals - even worms, mites and
        zooplankton - are equally sentient, and so vegans <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_5.1_speciecism"
            rel="nofollow">discriminating</a> them by not recognizing their sentience.</p>
    <p><strong>Self-defense</strong></p>
    <p>Finally, a vegan might justify their cruel behaviour by calling the animals <em>pests</em>,
        implying that <a href="https://i.imgur.com/NrM9Bfu.jpg" rel="nofollow">their lives are
            worthless</a> and that they therefore, literally, have no value and don't count.
        However, these are by far not the only animals that vegans slaughter because they use their
        <a href="https://www.nrdc.org/onearth/millions-songbirds-do-not-need-suffer-gruesome-deaths-olive-industry-can-save-buck"
            rel="nofollow">weapons of mass destruction</a> to kill innocent bystanders just for the
        sake of efficiency. If animals had rights, this vould <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/EtjagY9.jpg" rel="nofollow">violate the Geneva Convention</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Humans were the ones that conquered the land of the animals in the first place, and they will
        have to keep doing this in order to expand their crop yields. Vegans contradict their own
        concept of speciecism by proclaiming that they themselves are worth more than the animals
        they opress.</p>
    <hr>
    <p>What all of these arguments say is that vegans aren’t actually interested in the death toll
        of their food. They are only interested in making sure they <em>feel</em> good about what
        they are eating and having their lack of guilt and responsibility be accepted by those who
        collectively consider themselves morally superior in their ignorance about the total death
        toll of their food choices. In other words, it’s bad vegan logic that animals on your plate
        are important, but the small ones that can’t be quantified easily and don’t end up on your
        plate are not, no matter how many of them are killed or why. The vegan <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/rVTkhLK.png" rel="nofollow">here</a> seems to agree.</p>

        directly tied to crop pollination (and thus, crop production). Vegans are once again being

        the average person.</p>
    <p>This same hypocrisy is found in the fact that they <a

        consider the animals <em>enslaved</em> to create the delicious dairy products they so
        desperately try to mimic using plants. Yet, there are no stickers for their vegetables that
        say, “No animals were used in the fertilizing of this product”. Vegans will declare that it
        is "<a href="https://i.imgur.com/6r4NaMv.jpg" rel="nofollow">cruelty free</a>" to keep cows
        in confinement in order to harvest their waste products, but will sob and weep when same
        thing is done to harvest their milk.</p>

    <h3 id="wiki_3._anti-human_ideology">3. Anti-human ideology</h3>
    <p>At its core, the vegan ideology promotes the abstinence from any "unnecessary" animal
        suffering that is inflicted to support human health. While well-intended, this is an
        extremely harmful line of thinking.</p>
    <p>There are many examples of how veganism has negatively affected humans. One of them is the
        fact that vaccines contain animal products, which <a
            href="https://meaww.com/vegans-anti-vaxx-campaign-children-vaccines-animal-products-reddit-facebook-influenza-yolk-calf"
            rel="nofollow">has convinced some vegans</a> to stop using them because they <em>can
            live without them</em>, hence they are consistent with the philosophy. Likewise, the
        health section mentions the <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/health#wiki_1._authorities"
            rel="nofollow">many infants</a> that were permanently crippled because their parents put

            rel="nofollow">blanket claim</a> from an opinion paper written by three ethical vegans
        who did not disclose this conflict of interest. Likewise, <a
            href="https://www.vegansociety.com/whats-new/blog/vegan-animal-diets-facts-and-myths"
            rel="nofollow">public vegan communities</a> seem to <a
            href="https://www.peta.org/living/animal-companions/vegetarian-cats-dogs"
            rel="nofollow">encourage</a> people to put their carnivorous pets on a plant-based diet
        to "reduce" the suffering of other animals. In fact, 78% of vegans say <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/zP7GBIo.png" rel="nofollow">they would feed dogs and cats a
            plant-based diet</a>, while only 27% consider it immoral. There are also animal rights
        activists that have <a

    <p>If it is immoral to kill animals in order to support human health, then that's irrational and
        anti-human. Other than giving up meat, we would also have to have to stop using pesticides,
        killing mosquitoes, rats, fleas, termites, roaches and so on. We would also be obligated to
        malnourish ourselves so that we burn less calories, and therefore <a

            rel="nofollow">kill less animals</a>.</p>
    <p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Liberation_Front"
            rel="nofollow">terrorist organizations</a> like ALF who have send bomb letters and
        stalked children. Activist groups have <a href="https://youtu.be/Vp8-rYqCAnM"

            rel="nofollow">law</a> that makes it illegal for them to trespass. Indigenous people
        like <a href="https://youtu.be/F4tfmdv5Z7w" rel="nofollow">the Inuit</a> are living in
        poverty because anti-sealers have damaged their economy <em>for the animals</em>. Many
        activists also use their concept of <a

            rel="nofollow">rape</a>, murder and slavery.</p>
    <p>The typical response to this is that "not all vegans are like this", but that doesn't change
        the underlying events. The observation that there are nice vegans does not reverse the all
        suffering that was - fundamentally - caused by an ideology that uses good intentions to
        justify immoral actions. In fact, it is a common <a

    </blockquote>
    <h3 id="wiki_4._cult_ideology">4. Cult ideology</h3>
    <h4 id="wiki_4.1_definition_of_a_cult">4.1 Definition of a Cult</h4>
    <p>The definition of a cult is one that is often contentious because it is often considered a
        pejorative and also because the general definition is very broad. The general <a
            href="https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/cult" rel="nofollow">definition</a> is either
        a "relatively small group of people having religious beliefs or practices regarded by others
        as strange or sinister" or "A misplaced or excessive admiration for a particular person or
        thing." Despite this common misconception, the study and definition of cults especially how
        they form and what they are, is far more concise then generally known and very important to
        society; not least because it names and describes the behaviors of extremists and radical
        groups but also of demagogues and abusers. What makes a cult a cult (or a cult ideology) has
        been extensively researched and determined by a set of symptoms of thought and recognizable
        group behaviors by <a href="http://www.csj.org/infoserv_cult101/checklis.htm"
            rel="nofollow">many</a> in <a href="https://www.culteducation.com/warningsigns.html"
            rel="nofollow">academia</a>. </p>
    <p>These forms of measurement of cult behaviors don't require that in order for a cult to be a
        cult, it needs to have all the signs. If enough symptoms are present however, it's most
        likely you are dealing with at minimum, a "thought-stopping" ideology which prioritizes
        identity and feelings over critical thought, at maximum, an anti-social, and potentially
        dangerous cult group, such as a pyramid scheme, fascist political ideology, abusive family
        unit, or
        militant religion. </p>
    <h4 id="wiki_4.2_symptoms_of_cult_behavior">4.2 Symptoms of Cult Behavior</h4>
    <p>So how does veganism fall under the definition of a cult beyond the most broad application of
        the term?</p>
    <p>According to <a href="https://www.culteducation.com/warningsigns.html"
            rel="nofollow">CultEducation.Com</a>, warning signs of a cult are:</p>
    <p><em>1. Absolute authoritarianism without meaningful accountability.</em></p>
    <p>Veganism does not accept non-vegan views within the paradigm, no matter how specialized a
        person is regarding a subject that aligns with their cause (environmentalism, health,
        agriculture). Vegans will disavow people even with Ph.D qualifications if the person is not
        a member of their cause. They will demand a person become vegan first in order to be
        accepted by them. Even if the person is a <a href="https://youtu.be/XxWWI-lAnww"
            rel="nofollow">world-renowned activist or expert</a>, they will be discarded or
        demonised for not being vegan. </p>
    <p>This also extends to other activist groups not just individuals who may align with "vegan"
        causes. Vegans feel they have the moral authority to <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/zDB6r59.jpg" rel="nofollow">co-opt all movements</a> and to
        demand<a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQnK0cGa66A&amp;list=RDCMUCDW7bc62Y0bRowfYJFyoijw&amp;index=7"
            rel="nofollow"> even historically oppressed groups carry the cross</a> for veganism on
        top of their struggles or else they are illegitimate causes.</p>
    <p>Vegans are so self-centered and entitled in their beliefs they will co-opt <a
            href="https://imgur.com/a/ZQAgtic" rel="nofollow">religious iconography as their own</a>
        and are even so self-righteous they will visibly equate <a
            href="https://imgur.com/a/S61L8ID" rel="nofollow">slaughterhouses to the Holocaust of
            Jews by openly using a Nazi symbol to evoke equivalence</a> and <a
            href="https://imgur.com/a/xztYSh7" rel="nofollow">use images of Holocaust victims next
            to animals</a> This is so common, its gotten the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights_and_the_Holocaust" rel="nofollow">ADL
            to make a statement.</a></p>
    <p>In this way they truly believe that a superior sense of morality alone in of itself grants a
        person power and authority over others, much like a pacifist who declares themselves the
        boss of everyone while they sit and watch people fight for their lives against a genocide.
        This is the definition of elitism and is usually a sign of an actual activist group being
        covertly diluted by opressors from actual power into useless performativity of which members
        proceed to constantly attack each-other over. [citation needed.] </p>
    <p>Yet, vegans who are spokespersons for the movement are unquestionably correct as they are
        presented to outsiders, no matter if they lack credentials, or there is direct evidence they
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hO--6mFLcTg" rel="nofollow">contradict
            themselves</a>, nor if they are proven to have lied or are wrong by independent sources.
        All research is presumed to either be correct and support veganism, or if it does not
        support veganism, it is a malicious/discreditable source...a lie. Members suggest new
        followers or non-members to "research" veganism by <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/health#wiki_1._authorities"
            rel="nofollow">only using vegan sources</a>...although they hide the fact that all their
        "best" sources are from vegans who <a
            href="https://letthemeatmeat.com/post/22315152288/history-of-the-american-dietetic-associations"
            rel="nofollow">already agree with their causes</a>. (see: confirmation bias.) </p>
    <p>As long as you are a vegan, you cannot be questioned. Veganism cannot be critiqued either,
        vegans who are outed as abusers or people who <a href="https://pastebin.com/mcEWpJ6K"
            rel="nofollow">killed their child with the diet</a> are instantly declared "not really
        vegan" and thus the movement as a whole <a href="https://i.imgur.com/Gt4tUty.png"
            rel="nofollow">can remain free from criticism</a>. </p>
    <p>Behavior like this is also supported by black/white thinking and elitism. (citation needed)
    </p>
    <p><em>2. No tolerance for questions or critical inquiry.</em></p>
    <p>People who question the definition and tenets/commandments of veganism are treated with
        suspicion and often hate. Even if they question aspects of veganism which are difficult even
        for vegans to reconcile, such as pet ownership, bee pollination, pesticide use etc.;
        especially questions from fellow vegans. Vegans who are members of veganism are expected by
        the group to be loyal to the cause and not to question it ever or else they are betraying
        veganism. Often militant vegans will go after vegans who are not participating in activism
        enough or "correctly." Yet Vegans do as much as they can to present to the world that the
        vegan community is a monolith of agreement. Questions or critical inquiry that is perceived
        as negative to vegans from non-members are treated with at minimum condescension, at
        maximum, violent threats including <a
            href="https://la.eater.com/2016/4/29/11536438/cafe-gratitude-hollywood-reporter-vegan-animals-be-love-farm"
            rel="nofollow">death</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeU4p_5nH50"
            rel="nofollow">rape threats</a>. Fellow vegans who question how veganism is achieved
        whether it be actual commandments or recruitment methods are often psychologically split by
        the group, mobbed and labeled as fake vegans, non-compassionate, not caring enough,
        murderers, selfish and etc. . . </p>
    <p><em>3. No meaningful financial disclosure regarding budget, expenses such as an independently
            audited financial statement.</em></p>
    <p>Veganism does not have one organization, however, spokespersons for the vegan cause such as
        Dr. Gregor, Mic The Vegan and <a href="https://youtu.be/FF1eFio7fqw"
            rel="nofollow">Earthling Ed</a>, present themselves as philanthropists who make no money
        from their cause and have no sponsors. Other youtube personalities who are popular within
        the movement also do the same. They either claim they are not sponsored by anyone, and/or do
        not show the amounts of their sponsors and how the money is spent. If they do list who
        contributes financially to them by name, often how the money is spent is hidden.</p>
    <p>Much of their largest research papers were also produced by <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/6s35X68.jpg" rel="nofollow">highly compromised sources</a>.
    </p>
    <p><em>4. Unreasonable fear about the outside world, such as impending catastrophe, evil
            conspiracies, and resulting isolation from everyone non-vegan. (with persecution
            complexes as well.)</em></p>
    <p>Veganism as an ideological stance must necessarily perceive the majority of human society
        (everyone else who is not vegan) as hopelessly corrupt and amoral by comparison even <a
            href="https://imgur.com/a/8SJziSI" rel="nofollow">soul-less</a>. Everyday average people
        are "murderers", "rapists" and complicit in the mass "slavery" and "genocide" of animals.
    </p>
    <p>This makes the existence for a vegan dissonant and difficult with the "normal" "other" people
        and "normal" "other" institutions. Anyone not vegan, to a vegan, is a callous, selfish and
        <a href="https://imgur.com/a/eHToQa8" rel="nofollow">immoral being who is attacking vegans
            with their personal choices</a>, leading the world towards whole-sale environmental (and
        human) extinction.</p>
    <p>Vegans often depict their distortedly dark views with their <a

        achieve catharsis and relief from guilt. </p>

        are vegan for life (until death), and in this way they can demonize and disregard any voices

    <p><em>17. Vegans Use DoubleSpeak.</em> </p>
    <p>It's common for insular organizations especially ones that isolate others from the rest of

        are taboo or "other." Words that are distorted for their cause are: "murder", "rape",
        "genocide", "slavery." (all these terms require the victim to be human, vegans invent that
        these terms apply to animals despite no language on earth supporting this, especially legal
        language.) </p>
    <p>Another example of double speak is calling cow's milk <a href="https://imgur.com/a/MTRpjDY"

    <p><em>19. They Invoke Their Taboos While Vilifying Them</em></p>

        "Alternative Homo Sex" or the Sermon "Church Porn" or Confession "Christian Fortune
        Telling." This is often a tell-tale sign that you are in a cult with a manic grasp on
        reality and an intent to cause mental paralysis (stuck being constantly reminded of

    <h4 id="wiki_5.1_speciesism">5.1 Speciesism</h4>
    <p>All from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speciesism" rel="nofollow">wikipedia</a>:
    </p>
    <p>"Philosopher Carl Cohen stated in 1986: "Speciesism is not merely plausible; it is essential
        for right conduct, because those who will not make the morally relevant distinctions among
        species are almost certain, in consequence, to misapprehend their true obligations."[35]
        Cohen writes that racism and sexism are wrong because there are no relevant differences
        between the sexes or races. Between people and animals, he states, there are significant
        differences; his view is that animals do not qualify for Kantian personhood, and as such
        have no rights"</p>
    <p>Also:</p>
    <p>"Douglas Maclean questioned if different species can be fitted with human morality, observing
        that animals were generally held exempt from morality; Maclean notes that most people would
        try to stop a man kidnapping and killing a woman but would regard a hawk capturing and
        killing a marmot with awe and criticise anyone who tried to intervene. Maclean thus suggests
        that morality only makes sense under human relations, with the further one gets from it the
        less it can be applied"</p>
    <p>And:</p>
    <p>"Robert Nozick notes that if species membership is irrelevant, then this would mean that
        endangered animals have no special claim"</p>
    <h3 id="wiki_6._name_the_trait">6. Name The Trait</h3>
    <p>Many vegans have an odd obsession with pseudological proofs, the most iconic example being
        the <a href="https://i.imgur.com/xyLFimu.jpg" rel="nofollow">Name The Trait (NTT)
            argument</a> where they ask someone to justify meat consumption by naming a single trait
        that makes it okay to eat animals, but not humans. The irony is, NTT is not even logically
        valid because its premise implies that moral status must be granted by a single trait. This
        had led them to develop <a
            href="https://philosophicalvegan.com/wiki/index.php/NameTheTrait_2.0"
            rel="nofollow">NTT2</a>, which makes so many irrational assumptions that nobody ever
        uses it in an argument. So in essence, vegans that use NTT are typically just armchair
        philosophers that want to appear smart whilst relying on an illogical argument. What they
        really engage in is not logic, but sophistry.</p>
    <p>On top of that, NTT has many other flaws. For example, it is actually an informal fallacy
        called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_ignorance"
            rel="nofollow">argument from ignorance</a> because its conclusion is build on the
        premise that, if no trait has been named, it must therefore not exist. This is a classic
        example of burden of proof shifting, which vegans tend to use <a
            href="https://i.imgur.com/WQjP2Eb.png" rel="nofollow">quite a lot in general</a>.</p>
    <p>The irony of all this is that the conclusion of the NTT argument actually debunks veganism no
        matter the outcome. Let's just assume that the conclusion of NTT is true. After all, if NTT
        is false then vegans have no argument anyway. If NTT is true, then there is no moral
        justification to exploit animals, and we contradict ourselves with anything short of
        non-exploitation.</p>
    <p>This is where the flaw every logic argument for veganism stands out once again - because the
        NTT argument <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_2._vegan_hypocrisy"
            rel="nofollow">pretends that vegans don't exploit animals</a> when they factually do. In
        fact, even <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_1._definition_of_veganism"
            rel="nofollow">their own definition</a> states that it is okay for humans to exploit
        animals, and that merely the degree of exploitation should be reduced. Thus, because NTT
        states that there is no justification to exploit animals, but veganism justifies some
        exploitation of animals, they defeat their own argument. Their logic fails.</p>
    <p>So is there a single trait that grants a special moral status to humans? There are many
        individual things unique to humans that separate them from other animals, but NTT is a
        really disingenous argument because it asks for just a single one. This means that vegans
        can nearly always find an odd example to counter with:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You say "sapience", the vegan asks if it is okay to kill and eat mentally disabled
            people. (Note: handicapped people are still sapient, vegans just take advantage of them
            by painting them as less intelligent than they really are)</li>
        <li>You say "culture", the vegan asks if it is okay to kill and eat philistines.</li>
        <li>You say "morality", the vegan asks if it is okay to kill and eat prisoners.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By now it should seem apparent that the "logical" case for veganism rests entirely on the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_marginal_cases#Criticism"
            rel="nofollow">irrational</a> Argument from Marginal Cases. That is, relying on
        hypothetical scenarios that do not occur in reality. NTT is the same, it really just boils
        down to asking a single question, dressed up in misdirection and switchbacks:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>When is a human not a human?</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>This goes back to vegans <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_3._anti-human_ideology"
            rel="nofollow">having no respect</a> for their fellow members of society. What defines
        humans (or any species) is never given by a single "trait". Humans have the ability to
        reason, be cultured, cook, be religious, etc. This is a result of a shared ancestry that
        goes back hundreds of thousands of years. No human has all of these characteristics, but
        together they define humanity as a whole. Thus, trivial questions can be answered with
        equally trivial responses. The trait which separates humans from other animals is the trait
        of <em>being a human</em>.</p>

    <p>According to a <a

            rel="nofollow">survey</a>, documentaries (21.9%), internet videos (14.7%) and social
        media posts (13.2%) are the most effective ways of converting people into veganism. This
        means that the most convincing ethical arguments for veganism are not actually based on
        logic or reason, but rather on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_emotion"
            rel="nofollow">appeal to emotion</a> presented by propaganda videos which are
        accompanied by sad background music (e.g. Earthlings, Dominion, Dairy is Scary). Vegans thus
        have a strong interest in anthropomorphizing animals beyond their actual psychology and in
        portraying animal husbandry as malicious, as displayed in the following paragraphs.</p>
    <h4 id="wiki_7.1._staged_undercover_videos">7.1. Staged undercover videos</h4>
    <p>There are a number of videos in the internet showing recordings of farmers and
        slaughterhouses mistreating animals in order to promote veganism. It can reasonably be
        assumed that they are not documentaries, but <em>propaganda</em> that is at best distorted
        and at worst staged. Consequently, the US Fur Commission has been able to compile <a
            href="https://furcommission.com/saving-society-from-animal-snuff-films/"
            rel="nofollow">a list</a> of many easily verifiable cases, starting from the 1960s, of
        activists paying workers to abuse animals.</p>
    <p>Many farms legally require their employees to sign a contract which obligates them to report
        animal abuse cases (after all, even 1 out of 100 animals dying would heavily damage their
        profit margin after having invested a considerable amount of money into feed). But in order
        to obtain their recordings, animal rights advocates are <em>required</em> to stand by and
        watch all of it play out. One such example is Earthling Ed's film <em>Land of Hope and
            Glory</em>, which featured a scene of dairy cows being abused on an RSPCA Assured farm.
        However, the RSPCA responded that they <a
            href="https://www.rspcaassured.org.uk/land-of-hope-and-glory-film/" rel="nofollow">have
            not been contacted about this</a> at all, meaning that the so-called animal lover Ed
        Winters <em>stood by and watched all of it play out</em>.</p>
    <p>A common observation among these videos is that they are without context and only a few
        minutes long. In many cases, such as in a <a
            href="https://www.dairycarrie.com/2014/08/12/peta-dairy-farm-video/" rel="nofollow">PETA
            dairy farm video</a>, animals are located in areas where they are not even supposed to
        be. The fact alone that only 6 out of 82 undercover videos <a

            rel="nofollow">resulted in convictions</a> should make it quite obvious that vegans
        actively try to get their hands on misrepresentative footage. In fact, it is not even
        necessary for them to trespass on farms because all of them have welfare regulations that
        require them to be <a href="https://olaw.nih.gov/resources/tutorial/iacuc.htm"

            href="https://youtu.be/LsEbvwMipJI?t=418" rel="nofollow">video tour</a> of a pork plant,
        Temple Grandin explains that all holdings legally have to have access to water. She then
        goes on to show <a href="https://youtu.be/LsEbvwMipJI?t=461" rel="nofollow">an example</a>
        of how activists can take misleading shots to lie about holding pens being too crowded, when
        they actually have more than enough room.</p>
    <p>In a <a

            rel="nofollow">Reddit AMA</a>, an undercover investigator for an animal rights group
        outright admits that they were not looking to find and stop animal abuse, but to lobby for
        legislations against farms. <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/5sw8yy/i_was_an_undercover_investigator_for_an_animal/ddicep3/?context=3"

            rel="nofollow">also notes</a> that the Humane Society took in 134 million USD in 2015,
        of which they spent 58 million on shady offshore Caribbean investments. It is therefore not
        surprising that undercover activists can get paid <a

            rel="nofollow">up to 800 USD</a> per week just to aquire footage.</p>
    <p>Due to these occurrences, farms have now become <a
            href="https://animalagalliance.org/could-you-be-hiring-an-undercover-activist/"
            rel="nofollow">much more cautious</a> about who they hire - and so actvists are now
        using this to imply that farmers "have something to hide".</p>
    <h4 id="wiki_7.2._intensive_animal_farming">7.2. Intensive animal farming</h4>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/us-factory-farming-estimates"
            rel="nofollow">Sentience Institute</a> (an activist organization), 99% of US animals
        live on factory farms.</p>
    <p>First, it should be noted how this data was twisted in order to inflate the number: most
        (90%+) of these animals are birds, but poultry only makes up around <a
            href="https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/food-availability-per-capita-data-system/"
            rel="nofollow">half</a> of the meat consumed in the US. More importantly, the definition
        that was used for "factory farm" is the <a
            href="https://www3.epa.gov/npdes/pubs/sector_table.pdf" rel="nofollow">EPA
            definition</a> for concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOS) which classifies all
        operations with a certain number of animals as such, regardless of how much space they have
        or even if they are in a building. According to this classification, farms <a
            href="https://youtu.be/gFOP3sHmMiY" rel="nofollow">like this one</a> that have cattle
        graze as usual are "factory farms" just because they have a lot of animals.</p>
    <p>Vegans are particularly good in misrepresenting the beef industry. For example, the statement
        that <a href="https://www.meatinstitute.org/index.php?ht=a/GetDocumentAction/i/93607"
            rel="nofollow">only 5%</a> of US cattle are grass-fed might lead someone to believe that
        the most of them are in feedlots. But this is far from the truth - according to the <a
            href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/catl0120.pdf"
            rel="nofollow">official USDA numbers</a>, only about 15 million out of 94 million total
        cattle are currently on a feedlot. The overwhelming majority of them (around 75 million) are
        grazing on pasture. This is because "grain-fed" cattle are actually raised on grasslands
        together with their mother for the majority of their life and only sent to feedlots <a
            href="http://www.explorebeef.org/raisingbeef.html" rel="nofollow">towards the last few
            months</a> to be fattened and <em>grain finished</em>.</p>
    <p>Notably, even intensive farms are far from what they are made out to be in <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/ethics#wiki_7.1._staged_undercover_videos"
            rel="nofollow">propaganda videos</a>. Cattle feedlots generally plan to provide around
        <a href="http://gpvec.unl.edu/mud/enviro-mud-feedlotdesign-ksu.pdf" rel="nofollow">300
            square feet per head</a>, meaning the animals have plenty of space. Because bovines are
        herd animals, they just often choose to bunch together and so activists like to use
        conveniently angled pictures <a href="https://i.imgur.com/OMgmGn6.png" rel="nofollow">like
            these</a>, implying that the animals are locked up in some sort of cage when in fact
        there is a large area for them to walk around in the background.</p>
    <h4 id="wiki_7.3._animal_intelligence_studies">7.3. Animal intelligence studies</h4>
    <p>Being the agenda-driven lunatics that they are, vegans have not only <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AntiVegan/wiki/index/health#wiki_1.2._blanket_claims_and_conflicts_of_interest_in_vegan_position_papers"
            rel="nofollow">infiltrated nutritional position papers</a>, but also animal science
        institutions in order to anthropomorphize animals and promote a <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bambi_effect" rel="nofollow">bambi effect</a> to the
        general population. One great example of this is the <a
            href="https://www.peta.org/issues/animals-used-for-food/factory-farming/pigs/"
            rel="nofollow">common claim</a> that it is supposedly well-studied and documented that
        pigs are smarter than dogs, chimpanzees or even 3 year old humans.</p>
    <p>Anyone with even remotely sensible knowledge about biology or evolution would instinctively
        know that this isn't true. Since the majority of vegan websites do not even provide a
        citation for this claim, let's have a look at what the first genuine non-vegan source says
        about this <em>overwhelming science</em> which actually originates from a single study:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/are-pigs-intelligent_n_7585582"
            rel="nofollow">https://www.huffpost.com/entry/are-pigs-intelligent_n_7585582</a></p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>The paper was funded by Someone, Not Something, a project of Farm Sanctuary, an
                animal rescue organization.</strong> Someone, Not Something is an exploration of the
            science behind the emotions, intellect and social behavior of farm animals, with the aim
            of extending greater compassion and legal protection to these creatures.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>and:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Authors Lori Marino, a neuroscientist and founder of the Kimmela Center for
                Animal Advocacy</strong>, and Christina M. Colvin, a professor at Emory University,
            note in their paper that pigs have been found to be mentally and socially similar to
            dogs and chimpanzees.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>So how did they come to this conclusion? By using weasel words to create a false analogy:</p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>“What is known suggests that pigs are cognitively complex and <strong>share many
                traits</strong> with animals whom we consider intelligent,” they write in the paper,
            titled “Thinking Pigs: A Comparative Review of Cognition, Emotion, and Personality in
            Sus domesticus.”</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Sharing traits does not make animals "as smart as". Parakeets have traits that probably can
        be measured as "shared" with chimpanzees and dogs, such as voice recognition, pattern
        recognition, empathy, complex social bonds, and probably more vocal/language abilities than
        a pig or a dog. This is like saying because both EMT workers and surgeons know the basics of
        anesthesia, EMT workers are "as skilled as" surgeons.</p>
    <p>Looking more into this, there's another article here:</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.seeker.com/iq-tests-suggest-pigs-are-smart-as-dogs-chimps-1769934406.html"
            rel="nofollow">https://www.seeker.com/iq-tests-suggest-pigs-are-smart-as-dogs-chimps-1769934406.html</a>
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p>"We have shown that pigs share a number of cognitive capacities with other highly
            intelligent species such as dogs, chimpanzees, elephants, dolphins, and even humans,"
            neuroscientist Lori Marino of Emory University and The Nonhuman Rights Project said in a
            press release. "There is good scientific evidence to suggest we need to rethink our
            overall relationship to them."</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>Note again they state they "share a number of cognitive capacities" as a way of saying they
        are equivalent. So here are the traits they share:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>have excellent long-term memories</li>
        <li>are whizzes with mazes and other tests requiring location of objects</li>
        <li>can comprehend a simple symbolic language and can learn complex combinations of symbols
            for actions and objects</li>
        <li>love to play and engage in mock fighting with each other, similar to play in dogs and
            other mammals</li>
        <li>live in complex social communities where they keep track of individuals and learn from
            one another</li>
        <li>cooperate with one another</li>
        <li>can manipulate a joystick to move an on-screen cursor, a capacity they share with
            chimpanzees</li>
        <li>can use a mirror to find hidden food</li>
        <li>exhibit a form of empathy when witnessing the same emotion in another individual</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Despite the questionable backing of this research, lets assume they are all true and none of
        this was evidence that was compelled or compiled in a manipulative or dishonest way. The
        only two traits that really stick out as approaching <em>most monkeys</em> are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>can comprehend a simple symbolic language and can learn complex combinations of symbols
            for actions and objects</li>
        <li>can manipulate a joystick to move an on-screen cursor, a capacity they share with
            chimpanzees</li>
    </ul>
    <p>But even these don't make them "as smart as" chimpanzees, although definitely as smart as
        rats. However, considering the methods and conflicts of interest it is highly questionable
        as to how this data was compiled.</p>
    <p>Besides, it's really problematic to compare pigs to 3 year olds. Even a 3 year old is smarter
        than a chimpanzee, as their language capacity already outstrips them. No pig is going to be
        able to make jokes about their father's pronounciation of certain words <a
            href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ContagiousLaughter/comments/ayiack/this_2_year_old_mocking_his_dads_accent/"
            rel="nofollow">like here</a> - and that video is of a <em>2 year old</em>. No pig, chimp
        or any other really smart animal comes anywhere close to even the youngest human beings.</p>
