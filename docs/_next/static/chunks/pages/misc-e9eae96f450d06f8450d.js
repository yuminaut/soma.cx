Avoid industrial skin care products and PUFAs.\n\n\n## Physiognomy\n\n(TODO: All these links should be archived!)\n\n- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiognomonics\n- https://archive.org/details/worksaristotle00arisuoft/page/n51/mode/2up\n- https://www.light.org/Instantaneous-Character-Reading-SL121.cfm\n- https://www.light.org/Instantaneous-Reading-from-Profile-SL123.cfm\n- https://twitter.com/S1nge_/status/1366768121579786245\n\n## Breast Enlargement\n\n- [Breast Enlargement Botanicals (PDF)](/pdf/Breast-Enlargement-Botanicals.pdf)\n- [More herbs](https://www.breastnexus.com/showthread.php?tid=21602) /\n  [Archive 1st page](https://archive.is/FLMRf)\n  - [Backup](/pdf/breast-enlargement-herbs.txt)\n- [breast.is](https://breast.is/)\n- [http://busty.jugem.jp/](http://busty.jugem.jp/)\n\n\n## Drink warm water, not cold\n\nCold water (especially with ice) restricts blood vessels lining the gut,\nincreases mucus production, and neutralizes digestive enzymes. Warm or lukewarm\nwater is better for digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\nThis is supported by tradition, for instance the Chinese and the Ayurvedic.\n\nThere\'s also some research on it:\n\n- [_Effects of drinking hot water, cold water, and chicken soup on nasal mucus velocity and nasal airflow resistance_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/359266/)\n- [_Effects of hot tea, coffee and water ingestion on physiological responses and mood: the role of caffeine, water and beverage type_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002130050438?LI=true)\n- [_Water ingestion increases sympathetic vasoconstrictor discharge in normal human subjects_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11222121/)\n- [_Response of esophagus to high and low temperatures in patients with achalasia_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23105999/)\n\nTry to have warm with your food instead and see for yourself.\n\n\n## Gut-brain axis & gut microbiota\n\nRather than me poorly trying to explain this, you\'d do well to research this\non your own. I will just point you in the right direction.\n\nThere\'s considerable research indicating that there is a bidirectional\ncommunication going on between your gut and your brain\u2014this is termed the\n_gut-brain axis_. In a healthy individual the gut and the brain work together\nsmoothly, but in an individual with gut dysbiosis this communication is\ndisrupted and all sorts of chronic diseases appear, including irritable bowel\nsyndrome, depression, autism spectrum disorder, irritable bowel syndrome,\nAlzheimer\'s disease, other neuropsychiatric disorders, and chronic inflammation\nin general.\n\nInside your gut, your intestines, live trillions of bacteria (microbiota).\nSome of these have a parasitic relationship with you\u2014hijacking your system for\ntheir own gain at your expense\u2014while others function symbiotically.\n\nWhat you want to do is to stop introducting and feeding parasitic microbiota,\nand start introducting and feeding symbiotic microbiota. This can be done in\na number of ways but the simplest one is via diet. In order to starve the former\nI suggest following a diet similar to the one I have outlined on my nutrition\npage, and in order to introduce the latter I suggest regularly eating probiotic\nfood, such as sauerkraut or kefir\n([more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fermented_foods)). Just\nbeware of _pasteurized_ fermented foods; pasteurization kills most bacteria!\nBut assert the quality of the food and its preparation, don\'t get sick.\n\n### Research\n\nDo your own research and draw your own conclusions. Visit\n[PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) or\n[PubMed Central](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/) (the latter has full text\narticles) and search for e.g. "gut microbiota", "gut-brain axis", or any of\nthose two plus your subject of interest e.g. "gut microbiota depression".\n\nI\'ll link a few interesting articles here below.\n\n**Reviews, ordered by most recent first**\n\n- [Gut Microbiome: Profound Implications for Diet and Disease (2019 Jul 16)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6682904/)\n- [Gut Microbiota and Their Neuroinflammatory Implications in Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (2018 Nov 14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6266223/)\n- [Neurotransmitter modulation by the gut microbiota (2018 Aug 15)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6005194/)\n- [The gut microbiota and healthy aging (2018 Jul 19)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6191326/)\n- [The role of the microbiome for human health: from basic science to clinical applications (2018 May 10)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5962619/)\n- [Human Gut Microbiota and Gastrointestinal Cancer (2018 Feb 21)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6000254/)\n- [Influence of gut microbiota on neuropsychiatric disorders (2017 Aug 14)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5558112/)\n- [Gut-Brain Axis and Behavior (2017 Mar 27)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6103442/)\n- [Gut Microbiota-brain Axis (2016 Oct 5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5040025/)\n- [Gut microbiota in autism and mood disorders (2016 Jan 7)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4698498/)\n- [Gut/brain axis and the microbiota (2015 Mar 2)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4362231/)\n\n**Randomized control trials**\n\n- [Intermittent fasting confers protection in CNS autoimmunity by altering the gut microbiota (2018 Jun 5)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6460288/)\n- And much more... filter your search by "Randomized control trial" in PubMed.\n';t.default=function(n){var t=n.topbar;return(0,r.jsxs)("div",{className:"page default-page",children:[(0,r.jsx)(e.default,{children:(0,r.jsx)("title",{children:"Misc"})}),t,(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"wrapper",children:(0,r.jsx)(a(),{children:s})})]})}},1534:function(n,t,i){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/misc",function(){return i(2658)}])}},function(n){n.O(0,[774,532,888,179],(function(){return t=1534,n(n.s=t);var t}));var t=n.O();_N_E=t}]);
