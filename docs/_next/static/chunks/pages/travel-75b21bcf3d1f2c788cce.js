Follow the advice from either of these pages:\n\n- [/r/onebag wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/onebag/wiki/index)\n- [onebag.com](https://www.onebag.com/)\n\nWhy pack light? From the onebag.com page:\n\n- Security \u2013 you can always keep your single bag on you\n- Economy \u2013 no need to check luggage or pay for transport for walkable distances\n- Mobility \u2013 you're never held back by heavy luggage\n- Serenity \u2013 less stuff to lose, easy to pack and unpack\n\n### Minimum viable packing list\n\nHere follows a very minimal packing list. In general you don't _need_ more than\nthis, but you should of course adjust for climate, comfort, and niche needs.\nSo if you're going to a beach town obviously also pack swimwear, duh (or better\nyet, find shorts that double as swimwear). If you're a photographer bring your\ncamera. And so on.\n\n- **Clothing** (wear one item from each bullet point):\n  - 3 x Shirts\n  - 3 x Underwear\n  - 3 x Socks\n  - 1 x Pants\n  - 1 x Shoes\n  - Adjust layers according to climate\n- **Technology & Entertainment**\n  - Phone \u2013 for GPS, ongoing trip planning and connecting with people you meet\n  - Earbuds \u2013 not essential, I like to be part of the surroundings\n  - Book or E-reader \u2013 good for long transports\n  - Necessary chargers\n- **Documents**\n  - Wallet + Cash\n  - Passport\n  - Small pen \u2013 always useful\n  - Small notebook \u2013 optional\n- **Hygiene & Miscellaneous**\n  - Dry bag _or_ sink stopper \u2013 see the laundry section below\n  - Clothesline \u2013 ditto\n  - Eye mask\n  - Ear plugs\n  - Toothbrush\n\nToothpaste, soap and other hygiene articles can be bought at the destination or\nbrought with you, it's up to you.\n\n**How big a backpack do I need?**\n\nFor the above list, no more than 15L. But you'll likely want to pack more than\nwhat's in there. There are many packing list examples on the \"onebag\" links\nabove. You shouldn't need more than 30L, in my opinion.\n\n**But how am I supposed to survive with only three sets of clothing?**\n\nJust do your laundry during your daily shower. One set of clothing to wear, one\nto clean and dry, and one as a buffer for a day when you might be too busy.\n\n### Laundry\n\nThe dead sinple way to clean is to use a dry bag, 5-10L in size. You simply pour\nsome shampoo or shower gel into it, then some hot/warm water until it lathers,\nput clothes inside, shake around, let sit for 10 minutes or more if really\ndirty. Empty and rinse in the shower or sink. Usually underwear and socks are\neasier to wash by hand directly, and then you don't need more than a 5L dry bag.\nDon't worry, this method _does_ in fact clean your clothes very well.\n\nHang your clothes to dry overnight or during the day, using hangers or the\nlightweight clothesline you brought with you.\n\nIf you are lazy, have more clothes with you and are in a country where laundry\nservice is cheap, you can have it done for you for the equivalent of 1-2 USD\nper kg.\n\n## Being social\n\nTraveling alone and want to have fun and meet people? Stay in a hostel that has\ngood reviews (and reviews that mention a \"social atmosphere\") and you'll be able\nto meet people from all over the world. But do bring ear plugs and an eye mask.\n\nWant to connect and make friends with locals? Learn the basics of their language\nor at least some phrases such as \"good day\", \"thank you\", etc. It will really\nmake people open up.\n\n## Other\n\nThis page will be updated as more things related to travel come to mind.\n";n.default=function(e){var n=e.topbar;return(0,i.jsxs)("div",{className:"page default-page",children:[(0,i.jsx)(a.default,{children:(0,i.jsx)("title",{children:"Travel"})}),(0,i.jsx)("img",{src:"/img/bg/tajikistan.jpg",className:"fullSizeBackground",style:{opacity:.1}}),n,(0,i.jsx)("div",{className:"wrapper",children:(0,i.jsx)(r(),{children:s})})]})}},3742:function(e,n,o){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/travel",function(){return o(1986)}])}},function(e){e.O(0,[774,532,888,179],(function(){return n=3742,e(e.s=n);var n}));var n=e.O();_N_E=n}]);
