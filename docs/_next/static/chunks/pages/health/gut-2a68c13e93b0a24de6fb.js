I will just point you in the right direction.\n\nThere\'s considerable research indicating that there is a bidirectional\ncommunication going on between your gut and your brain\u2014this is termed the\n_gut-brain axis_. In a healthy individual the gut and the brain work together\nsmoothly, but in an individual with gut dysbiosis this communication is\ndisrupted and all sorts of chronic diseases appear, including irritable bowel\nsyndrome, depression, autism spectrum disorder, irritable bowel syndrome,\nAlzheimer\'s disease, other neuropsychiatric disorders, and chronic inflammation\nin general.\n\nInside your gut, your intestines, live trillions of bacteria (microbiota).\nSome of these have a parasitic relationship with you\u2014hijacking your system for\ntheir own gain at your expense\u2014while others function symbiotically.\n\nWhat you want to do is to stop introducting and feeding parasitic microbiota,\nand start introducting and feeding symbiotic microbiota. This can be done in\na number of ways but the simplest one is via diet. In order to starve the former\nI suggest following a diet similar to the one I have outlined on my nutrition\npage, and in order to introduce the latter I suggest regularly eating probiotic\nfood, such as sauerkraut or kefir\n([more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fermented_foods)). Just\nbeware of _pasteurized_ fermented foods; pasteurization kills most bacteria!\nBut assert the quality of the food and its preparation, don\'t get sick.\n\n## Research\n\nDo your own research and draw your own conclusions.
