Warm or lukewarm\nliquids are better for digestion and nutrient absorption.\n\nThis is supported by tradition, for instance the Chinese and the Ayurvedic.\n\nThere's also some research on it:\n\n- [_Effects of drinking hot water, cold water, and chicken soup on nasal mucus velocity and nasal airflow resistance_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/359266/)\n- [_Effects of hot tea, coffee and water ingestion on physiological responses and mood: the role of caffeine, water and beverage type_](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002130050438?LI=true)\n- [_Water ingestion increases sympathetic vasoconstrictor discharge in normal human subjects_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11222121/)\n- [_Response of esophagus to high and low temperatures in patients with achalasia_](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23105999/)\n\nTry to have warm liquids with your food instead and see for yourself (but don't\ndrink too much or you'll inhibit digestion).\n";e.default=function(n){var e=n.topbar;return(0,r.jsxs)("div",{className:"page default-page",children:[(0,r.jsx)(t.default,{children:(0,r.jsx)("title",{children:"Misc"})}),e,(0,r.jsx)("div",{className:"wrapper",children:(0,r.jsx)(a(),{children:s})})]})}},1534:function(n,e,i){(window.__NEXT_P=window.__NEXT_P||[]).push(["/misc",function(){return i(2658)}])}},function(n){n.O(0,[774,532,888,179],(function(){return e=1534,n(n.s=e);var e}));var e=n.O();_N_E=e}]);
