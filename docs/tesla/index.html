      <h3>
        Electrical Wizard, Inventor of Wireless and Power Transmission, Tells
        His Secrets of Keeping Fit
      </h3>
      <p>
        “Lacking but two years of eighty, I am as fit today as I was at twenty.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Tall, slim, erect, Nikola Tesla was walking briskly across the mezzanine
        floor of the metropolitan hotel where he lives. There was a sheen in his
        white hair, and in his blue eyes an unquenchable fire. Time, the great
        antagonist of all men, has not been able to worst the illustrious
        inventor in a bout of nearly four-score years.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that time, Tesla has given to the world five thousand inventions and
        ideas. “As a matter of history,” says C. F. Scott, President of the
        American Institute of Electrical Engineers, “it is the Tesla principle
        and the Tesla system which have been the directing factors in modern
        electrical engineering practise.” “His name,” adds B. A. Behrend,
        engineer and author, “marks an epoch in the advance of electrical
        science.” Tesla discovered wireless before Marconi. He solved the secret
        of high frequency transmissions. His induction motor runs 10,000 ships
        and plants. Niagara Falls is chained according to his system.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Tesla's inventions were suddenly withdrawn, half of the
        transportation systems and half of the industries of the world would
        stand still. Today at seventy-eight, Tesla still works in three
        different laboratories. He devotes the major part of his time to the
        completion of a device which, if successful, will put an end to war.
        There are innumerable other tricks in the bag of this electric magician.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was eager to discover how the man who has energized our epoch and
        helped to make it the Machine Age, recharges the battery of his own
        body. I met him one afternoon emerging from a long conference, which in
        turn had followed many hours of laboratory work. But Tesla showed no
        trace of fatigue. We talked — talked for two hours. At the end he seemed
        perfectly fresh and wended his way on foot to a special research room of
        the New York Public Library where he often devotes many hours to his
        studies.
      </p>
      <p>
        “How,” I asked, “do you find it possible to continue your labors with
        undiminished vigor at seventy-eight? What is your secret of youth?”
      </p>
      <p>
        A smile crept over Tesla's features. “It is no secret, but common sense.
        I look upon the human body as a machine, and I treat it with the respect
        which a machine deserves. I keep it properly oiled and properly cleaned,
        and I see to it that it has no opportunity to gather rust.
      </p>
      <p>
        “The most important element in my scheme of life is my diet. You cannot
        expect a machine to function well if you do not provide it with the
        proper fuel.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Being a scientist, I attempt to regulate the machine which I call my
        body according to the laws of the planet on which I live. Whatever
        scheme of life man adopts, it must conform to the physical condition
        created by the rotation of the globe. The physical law which divides
        twenty-four hours into day and night also divides man's life into two
        periods — one in which he lives and another in which he rests. This in
        itself seems to indicate the desirability of two meals a day in unison
        with the world rhythm — one meal to give us energy for the day's work,
        another to supply the body with the material with which it will
        replenish itself during sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I have been interested in physical culture eyer since I was a young man
        and have experimented with different nutritional theories. In my early
        youth I concluded that the ideal way was to absorb food in a fine,
        almost fluid form and in the proper volume continuously, in small
        amounts, throughout our hours of work. This method, it seemed to me,
        would supply steadily energy to the body and impose the least strain
        upon the digestive organs. Fascinated by the theory, I lived that way
        for several years, preparing myself dishes consisting of milk, beef
        juice, and purees. Working in the laboratory, I took my nourishment
        whenever I felt the need. My health was excellent, my heart and my
        digestive organs reacted most favorably.
      </p>
      <p>
        “However, my work called me away to places where it was impossible for
        me to prepare my food in the fashion to which I had accustomed myself. I
        was compelled to take my meals like other men. The change caused
        considerable digestive disturbances. My intestines and my stomach had
        shrunk and my interior organs had lost much of their peristaltic power.
        It took me a long time to adjust myself to the new regimen.”
      </p>
      <p>“How many meals a day did you find most conducive to health?”</p>
      <p>
        Tesla laughed: “I have tried everything - six meals a day, like most
        Europeans; three a day, one a day; I have tried continuous feeding.
        Finally I decided that two meals are most beneficial.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Lunch is a superfluous meal, because it is futile in the economy of the
        human body. Lunch loads the stomach with food which it cannot transform
        quickly into energy for work. It takes from three to four hours before
        we can digest our luncheon: three or four hours before the food takes
        effect. Hence, lunch does not increase our efficiency. On the contrary,
        the digestive process summons the blood from the brain to the stomach
        and impedes our mental and physical activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        “One meal a day does not furnish sufficient energy and can not be
        harmonized with the movement of the clock which regulates our lives —
        the earth spinning about itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Two meals can be distributed so as to fit into the natural scheme
        prescribed by the rotation of the earth. Two meals a day improved my
        health, sharpened my appetite, and increased the sensitiveness of my
        palate. I did not know what life was until I eliminated lunch. Today at
        seventy-eight I enjoy my two meals to the same degree as when I was a
        boy of sixteen. I do not suffer from dyspepsia or any other aliment. I
        never find it necessary to take laxatives or other medicaments.
      </p>
      <p>
        “If my scheme is adopted universally, it will lengthen man's span of
        life and improve the health of the human race. It is impossible to
        distribute three meals to advantage. Two meals a day enables the worker
        to absorb and digest his meal before he begins to work.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “And what is the time which you select for your meals according to your
        gastro-culinary scheme of existence?”
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>Tesla is one of our very great men.</p>
        <p>
          This is the inspiring story of what his two-meals-per-day plan and a
          daily ten-mile walk have done for him. Ten miles of walking and two
          meals a day of the right food will keep any man still young and strong
          at Tesla's time of life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of Mr. Tesla's views do not conform to our own in every detail,
          but are the result of his personal experiences, and our readers are
          entitled to have the benefit of his views first hand.<br />— Bernarr
          Macfadden
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        “The time for eating,” Tesla replied, “depends upon climate and
        conditions of the country. We should take breakfast two hours before we
        start to work, and we should rest two hours afterward. If a man has his
        breakfast between seven and eight, he should begin work at ten, work
        continuously for five or six hours, which would mean that his work day
        ended at three or four; then he should go home, and devote several hours
        to recreation, rest and exercise, and take his final meal between seven
        and eight at night. This arrangement fits in with the cosmic law as well
        as with the new hours of labor, and it puts the worker in fine
        condition.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “What is the fuel which you consider most essential for the human
        machine?”
      </p>
      <p>
        “Every meal should have some protein and fat, the one for building, the
        other for burning. Protein builds, fat is a fuel — it energizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        “In the morning fat should be commended, because fat, taken preferably
        in the form of butter and oil, is what we need for our work. In the
        evening I suggest a preponderance of protein to rebuild the cells of the
        body while it rests.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “I believe with Bernarr Macfadden in the miracle of milk. There are two
        hundred and sixty grains of protein in one pint of milk. It is easily
        assimilated. Mr. Ford, unlike Mr. Macfadden, does not believe in milk.
        He feels it should be artificially manufactured. Unlike Ford, I believe
        in milk. Ford should take to milk if he wants to turn out more millions
        of his ‘Lizzies.’
      </p>
      <p>
        “Another excellent ingredient for food is the white of an egg. There are
        sixty grains of protein in each white of an egg, and only forty grains
        in the yolk. I prefer to eat only the white. The yolk contains iron and
        vitamins which are good, but also uric acid, which I avoid as much as
        possible. Cheese is the most nourishing of all foods, containing one
        hundred and forty grains of protein per ounce. The next best
        protein-containing substances are certain cereals which contain thirty
        to thirty-five grains per ounce of food. Rice carries the least uric
        acid and can be assimilated most easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        “A large amount of protein is contained in pulses or leguminous
        products, beans, peas, lentils, etc. But they also contain no small
        amount of uric acid. Uric acid is responsible for most ailments which
        impede the metabolistic processes of the body, It causes rheumatic
        conditions, arthritis, high blood pressure, and many other maladies of
        civilized life. Primitive man may have been able to eliminate uric acid
        thoroughly by hard physical labor. The city dweller should be
        exceedingly cautions before he introduces large amounts into his system.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Vegetables are indispensable to any diet, although they contain only
        six or seven grains of protein per ounce. They do not build and they
        supply little energy, but they regulate the bowels and counteract uric
        acid. They also supply the body with the vitamins and essential mineral
        salts. Moreover, they are convenient carriers for fat. I am fond of a
        fine, cooked mixture of onions and chopped celery prepared with a great
        deal of butter. This combination is easily digested. I have in part
        subsisted on it for many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Fruit, too, is an essential part of any well-regulated diet. It is
        indispensable, partly because of its bulk which aids the digestion, and
        partly because of its alkaline reaction. It is a well-known fact that
        even citrous fruits, which have an acid reaction at first, change to
        alkaline in the processes of digestion. The alkaline are the natural
        enemies of the acids. Sugar in small amounts is not objectionable. There
        is, however, plenty of sugar in fruit.”
      </p>
      <p>“Are you a vegetarian or a carnivorous animal?”</p>
      <p>
        Tesla replied, “I eat meat only at rare intervals, possibly only once or
        twice a year. It is rich in proteins but also in uric acid. I prefer
        fowl to beef. Fish is more digestible and almost equally rich in
        proteins and in fats. The phosphorous it contains is excellent for the
        nervous system. But phosphorus, while feeding the brain, causes acidity.
        Both meat and fish give us quick energy. Under certain conditions, for
        certain workers, they are indispensable. They shorten life by
        introducing more uric acid into the system than it can conveniently
        eliminate. But while we live they give us considerable vigor.”
      </p>
      <p>“And what,” I asked, “is your attitude toward alcohol?”</p>
      <p>
        “Since prohibition was enacted I have not touched a drop, and long
        before that I gave up all other stimulants. I gave up alcohol, in spite
        of the fact that it was beneficial to me, in obedience to the law, and I
        find that I cannot now return to it. I had previously expected to live
        150 years. Now that I have given up alcohol, I have reduced my
        expectancy of life to 135 years. In Yugoslavia, where I was born,
        alcoholic drinks are taken regularly with meals. That habit rarely leads
        to drunkenness.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Alcohol has helped me a great deal in my life. It has made possible for
        me to escape from a strain which otherwise might have proved fatal. The
        man who is not an inventor cannot realize how powerfully the entire
        system may be affected by the discovery of a new truth. When I first saw
        my own invention, the induction motor, at work, my heart nearly gave
        out. Fortunately a bottle of brandy was near at hand of which I partook.
        This balanced my nervous excitement, and I was able to survey the
        rotation of the motor with philosophic poise.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I was strongly addicted to coffee, with the result that my heart was
        subjected to a dangerous over-strain. It took me eleven years to
        vanquish my craving for this pernicious drink. The cure cost me a good
        deal of money. For eleven years I had the finest coffee prepared for me
        at my table every day, and never touched a drop. Its presence aroused my
        powers of resistance. If it had not been there I would have suffered
        from the craving. I, at least, have found coffee and tea rank poisons.”
      </p>
      <p>“You have not,” I interrupted, “expressed your opinion on beer.”</p>
      <p>
        “I have cared less for beer than for wine or brandy. As a young student
        I drank beer moderately, about sixteen seidels a day, whereas most of my
        fellow students consumed sixty. Beer gave me a katzenjammer. It is drunk
        in large quantities because for some reason it is easily absorbed. No
        one can drink twenty or thirty glasses of water or milk, but it is not
        difficult to drink thirty or forty glasses of beer. Owing to the large
        volume he consumes, the beer drinker absorbs more alcohol than the
        whiskey drinker. Moreover the tremendous amount of liquid which he gulps
        down enlarges his stomach and increases his girth. Some people seem to
        thrive on beer but they usually acquire enormous bellies.
      </p>
      <p>“And what,” I asked, “is your attitude toward smoking?”</p>
      <p>
        Mr. Tesla's defense of alcohol as against coffee and tea had left me
        somewhat startled. However, it seems that Tesla is no friend of the
        weed.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I have smoked a good deal, but when I was about twenty I gave a promise
        to stop, and smoked my last cigar. Smoking stimulates thought on general
        subjects; but is an enemy to concentration. The most stimulating
        activity, to my mind, is walking. I walk never less than ten miles a
        day. This has kept me in good health, but it may in the end lead to my
        destruction, because I am a confirmed jay-walker.
      </p>
      <p>
        “My exercise,” Tesla continued, “is not confined to my ten-mile walk. I
        bathe every day and I exercise in my bath. I have acquired great
        proficiency in these exercises. I have, in some respects, the agility of
        a baby. There is hardly a movement I cannot make except I cannot kiss my
        elbow. I can clamp a piece of paper between my shoulder blades and hold
        it so firmly that no one can remove it without tearing it off.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It seems curious,” I said, “that you, who are one of the master minds
        in electricity, do not use it to recharge your own energies.”
      </p>
      <p>“Why, of course I do,” Tesla replied.</p>
      <p>
        “Many years ago I discovered the therapeutic uses of electricity,
        especially of the high-frequency current. I announced my discovery in
        this field in 1891.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I believe in what may be called a waterless bath, by which 1 mean
        charging of the body to a very high electric potential. It is a bath of
        fire that rebuilds, rejuvenates, cleans, and exhilarates. It carries off
        instantly all dust, impurities and microbes, and stimulates the tips of
        the nerves. While in the bath the body is surrounded by a halo of light,
        plainly visible in the dark. I am now working on an apparatus which will
        make this electric bath safe and economically possible, even for a
        person of average means.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Tesla, unlike Edison and Marconi, is a bachelor. He prefers to be wedded
        to science. It seemed all the more important to discover his attitude on
        sex — sex, the most electrifying factor in the lives of most men. Tesla
        did not evade the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I recognize the importance that sex plays in the life of man. Nature
        has made its attraction irresistible to insure the perpetuity of the
        race. As for myself, I have found that the thinker is confronted with
        the problem of perpetuating either the species or the mind. It is almost
        impossible, at least in certain realms of high endeavor, to do both.
        This has been recognized by the Hindus, whose adepts practise complete
        sexual abstinence, and by many of the great religions.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Before I produced the rotating magnetic field, I concentrated all my
        powers upon my experiment. The strain would have killed a hundred oxen.
        I certainly could not have survived it if I had permitted my energies to
        be diverted into the channels of sex.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You have not,” I remarked, “told me the part played in your life by
        that great restorer of energy — sleep.” I asked this with malice
        aforethought, because I remembered that Tesla's great rival, Edison, had
        always claimed that he was able to get along with only a few hours of
        sleep.
      </p>
      <p>
        “I should say,” Tesla replied, “that a man who performs hard physical
        labor needs seven to eight hours of rest to recuperate, not necessarily
        eight hours of sleep. I myself sleep only two hours out of twenty-four.
        This does not mean that I may not assume a recumbent position, but my
        mind continues to work out its problems. I have often, during such
        apparent periods of rest, worked out my most difficult problems. In my
        younger days, I probably slept three to four hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        “When I sleep, I sleep profoundly. To sleep deeply, profoundly, is an
        art like deep breathing that must be learned. It is one of the secrets
        of the East. I think that I have discovered the secret. After a profound
        sleep, no matter how short, I feel so much refreshed that even now, when
        I am near eighty, I must perform gymnastic feats to subdue my new-gained
        vitality.”
      </p>
      <p>
        Edison, I interjected, “declared that he could get along on two or three
        hours of sleep.”
      </p>
      <p>Tesla's eyes twinkled merrily.</p>
      <p>
        “People sometimes deceive themselves,” he said. “Edison thought that he
        slept very little. As a matter of fact, I never knew anyone who slept as
        much as Edison. I have often seen him put his feet on the table in his
        laboratory and sleep for three or four hours. Then he would get up and
        work a little, only to take another nap of three or four hours.
        Naturally he did not have much need for sleep when the day was over.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “You would not,” I remarked, “recommend two hours of sleep or the
        extreme indulgence in brandy to other men.”
      </p>
      <p>
        “It is possible,” Tesla replied, shrugging his shoulders, “that my
        scheme of life may not help others unless it is modified in accordance

        seventy-eight years the machine which is Nikola Tesla.”
