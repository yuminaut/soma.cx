HOW TO REVERSE MYOPIA

At this point a huge portion of the population is
suffering from myopia (near-sightedness), and needs
glasses/contacts as a result, this is an introduction
to reversing this issue and restoring 20/20 vision.

Before I begin I want to be clear that I make no
promises that this will help every person's situation,
especially eyesight issues other than myopia.

That said, I have shared some or all of the info
here with 100+ people, and many of them have used
it to restore their vision.

---

Myopia, or near-sightedness as it's often called,
is the common condition in which people lose the
ability to see objects in the distance without
wearing corrective lenses.

It's incidence has increased exponentially over
the last century and is expected to continue rising.

---

Myopia stems from two primary causes:

The first is the eye itself getting longer,
and the fluid filled lens getting thicker.

The eye is completely surrounded by delicate muscles,
and would be fairly soft and malleable without them
holding it in place.

---

A pair of healthy human eyes are naturally adapted
to focus on objects 20+ feet away the majority of
the time.

When we spend too much time focusing on things
close to us it puts strain on our eyes, and over
time this causes permanent alterations in eye
shape/structure.

---

The second is oxidative stress in the eye, caused
by reactive oxygen species (ROS) like hydrogen
peroxide and iron oxide.

Our eyes are made primarily of the omega-3 fat
DHA, which is essential as a semiconductor and
photon-interrupter, yet highly prone to oxidative
damage.

---

When DHA is damaged by ROS it creates a compound
called CEP, which is used as a marker of macular
degeneration.

The oxidized lipid fragments the break off from
DHA being broken down react with other nearby fats,
creating a cascade of damage that can overwhelm
cell detox processes.

---

When these two factors occur at the same time it
creates the perfect conditions for eye damage,
by stressing the eye and altering it's structure
at the same time.

We are told that myopia is a life sentence, and that
our only options are corrective lenses or surgery.

---

It's taken me some to realize it, but this is a lie,
and at this point I've spoken with numerous people
that have proved to me that reversing myopia is
possible with a little time and effort.

There are two levels of myopia, and each is handled
differently:

---

The first is what's called psuedomyopia, where
eye strain from things like too much screen time
create mild/temporary myopia.

The eye will bounce back from this if the stressor
is removed, but most eye doctors will still give
you glasses for it, actually making the myopia worse.

---

If you want to reverse potential psuedomyopia or
prevent full myopia, take a break from reading or
staring at a screen at least every 20 minutes, and
for at least a few minutes get outside and/or stare
at something more than 20 feet away.

---

Full myopia may seem more intimidating, but it
can also be reversed by gradually tapering your
prescription and avoiding any more eye strain.

This pdf provides the best taper plan I've found,
as well as good info on how to easily prescribe
yourself glasses.

---

Don't bother with eye exercises advertised to
reverse myopia, as most provide only temporary
relief or take daily practice to acheive only
minor benefits.

The pdf info alone is enough to improve myopia,
however I'd also like to add a few ways to
solidify your improvement:

---

**1: Get plenty of retinol and DHA**

It's important to give your body the building
blocks it needs to be replace damaged lipids
in the eye, the most important is DHA itself.

I recommend eating seafood daily to support
myopia recovery, as well as general health.

---

The next most essential nutrient for eye health
after DHA is retinol, which is actually named
after it's function in the retina.

RETINOL is preformed vitamin A, which is then
converted into its analog RETINAL, retinal is
actually used to build photoreceptors throughout
the body.

---

Retinal catches photons and turns them into electric
impulses which travel through the lipid "wires" into
the brain.

Retinol is also an antioxidant, binding up damaging
ROS and stopping the lipid oxidation cascade, the
best food sources of retinol are liver and animal fats.

---

Plant vitamin A will NOT work unfortunately,
as it's poorly converted and can actually block
the retinol receptors.

Cod liver oil can be a good way to supplement retinol,
but be careful sourcing it as most fish oils are oxidized
from poor storage/manufacture (try Nordic Naturals).

---

**2: Avoid artificial light and get plenty of sunlight**

It's well established that artificial light (blue light)
is toxic, it essentially ages tissue by creating a buildup
of ROS and inflammatory signalling molecules, it's one of
the biggest causes of eyesight damage.

---

Sunlight in comparison is incredibly beneficial, and
sunlight exposure is tied to lower incidence of myopia,
as well as being protective against many other diseases
like obesity, heart disease, and cancer.

Try to get out in the sun for at least a few hours a day.

---

**3: Correcting iron dysregulation**

Put simply, iron dysregulation is when iron atoms aren't
properly loaded into proteins for use by the body.

Unbound iron atoms bind readily to oxygen, creating
iron oxide (rust), which damages any fat/protein
structures it comes in contact with.

---

Iron requires bioavailable copper, retinol, and
food-sourced vitamin C to be used correctly.

You can get the copper and retinol from foods like liver,
salmon, and oysters, and vitamin C from citrus fruits,
strawberries, rosehips, acerola cherry, or camu camu.

---

If you want to read a more detailed overview of iron
metabolism and guide to correct its dysrefulation,
I have on in the blog section of my website:

---

**4: Reducing inflammation**

Cutting out inflammatory triggers/foods will also reduce
cell damage and oxidative stress, the worst offenders are:

- wheat/corn/soy
- industrial seed oils
  -processed sugar/carbs/HFCS
- alcohol or other drugs
- iron fortified foods

---

**5: Clearing oxidative waste**

You can clear oxidized fats and damaged cells from
the eyes more efficiently by inducing a process
called autophagy.

The most potent methods I've found are through
fasting, or a low carb/ketogenic diet, there are
also many herbs/foods that support it.

---

You can also donate blood a few times per year,
and/or take either lactoferrin or IP6 to bind up
excess free iron in the body.

IP6 should only be taken away from food, as otherwise
it can prevent minerals in food from absorbing,
but the research on it shows many benefits.

---

The end.
