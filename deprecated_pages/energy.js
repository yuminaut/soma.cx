        <p>
          Every object, person, and location has a specific radio bandwidth of
          energy coded for you and only you. The fresh curious sensation you
          feel when something is new to you is hitting a fresh ore of this
          energy. Familiarity and boredom is you having drained rid energy
          source.
        </p>

        <div className="img-box">
          {/* <img src={a1} alt="" /> */}
          <img src={a2} alt="" />
          <img src={a3} alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          This source of energy, whether it be a new hangout spot, a fresh
          relationship, a recent gift, is used up in the process of speeding up
          your time. When the energy is drained, time will begin to slow.
          Personal emotional value feedback trickles to a drip.
        </p>

        <div className="img-box">
          <img src={b1} alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Energy sources can be revitalized over time, with breaks. They can
          also be altered and revitalized through change. Physical change to the
          source itself, or personal change. Rearranging personal perception
          through willpower can change your "bandwidth" to get different energy.
        </p>

        <div className="img-box">
          <img src={c1} alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Powerful experiences can alter and taint sources of energy,
          particularly large ones such as locations. Sensory experiences can be
          employed to purify energy sources. If a source cannot be altered from
          a negative frequency, its destruction will cease the energy
          altogether.
        </p>

        <div className="img-box">
          <img src={d1} alt="" />
          <img src={d2} alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Personal energy given off by people is part of an interconnected
          economy of energy, neutral sources, powerful suppliers, and
          unintentional leeches. There is also tainted energy from insidious
          sources of people. Usually the face reveals emotional frequency, but
          it can be hidden.
        </p>

        <div className="img-box">
          <img src={e1} alt="" />
          <img src={e2} alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Emotions are a both a symptom and cause of altering energy sources to
          alternate frequencies. Like two ripples in a pond intersecting and
          altering one another. Sexual interaction is one of the most powerful
          change in frequency and source or desiccant of energy output.
        </p>

        <div className="img-box">
          <img src={f1} alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Especially magnetic relationships can result in an unstable feedback
          loop which could result to changing incompatible frequencies at high
          velocity. Generally slightly less powerful energy is considered more
          stable but also less fulfilling.
        </p>

        <div className="img-box">
          <img src={g1} alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Sources of energy can be given residual imprints over time,
          strengthening their output like an overcharged battery. Objects less
          subject to alteration, with longer historical repetitive association
          with others tend to be more powerful, the most potent being celestial
          bodies.
        </p>

        <div className="img-box">
          <img src={h1} alt="" />
        </div>

        <p>
          Physical objects with residual buildup, usually through multiple
          sources over time, can provided a more focused source, but they have a
          high possibility of being destroyed or tainted without precautions
          from outside factors ie being destroyed or tainted by powerful emotion
          events
        </p>

          These are ideas readily accepted by literally everyone as separate
          concepts. The idea that there are underlying vibrational frequencies
          to everyone, which are manifested and manipulated on an emotional
          level, and through perception, all of it, is something everyone has
          accepted
        </p>

        <p>
          However, categorizing each of these common intuitive experiences as
          part of one grand unseen system is something suppressed and derided.
          Yet the truth of the nature of it cannot be fully concealed and
          reveals itself in the words we choose to describe this phenomenon.
